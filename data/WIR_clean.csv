"WIR-2022-000439","2/7/2022 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","Black bear mother and cubs have recently been much more aggressive in neighborhood and our house. In the last week:   1. Bears have destroyed metal grill protecting entrance to under house and multiple times occupied underneath house for extended periods (several hours through a day at a time).  2. Bears climbed over gates to walkway around rear of house. Cubs have sometimes gotten stuck causing mother to damage gates and destroy various potted plants, branches, fence palings, and other material in vicinity of gates.  3. Bears broke into outside refrigerator which was sealed (and had not had bears investigate it for 8+ years, the entire time we have lived in this location) and destroyed shelving and material inside.  4. Bears got into garbage stored in far rear small walkway behind house in gated/fenced area for first time since we have lived here (8+ years).  5. Defecation in numerous locations around the property, including immediately outside of front doors.  6. For the first time since we have resided at this property (to our knowledge), the bears are now climbing on the roof. Minor damage to windows and sun-roofs has resulted, but there are potential causes of concern (e.g. roof windows which could not support their weight).  7. Multiple neighbors (including the house immediately behind ours, and the house immediately across the street) have had the bears break into the house through locked doors or windows and spend extended periods of time inside the house, within the last two months. Especially concerning with two 7-year old children in the house.  We are concerned that the animals have been more aggressive and/or habituated. The incidents above were not the product of a single visit by the bears, but several repeated incidents over the last couple of weeks. In the last two months the number of similar reports we have heard from our neighbors outnumbers those we heard in the previous 8 years. Until a couple months ago there had not been a single report in our time at this location, to our knowledge, of the bears entering a house (just occasional garbage nuisance problems, when garbage bins were left out before trash day), and now both neighbors have reported it. In this same time the bears have repeatedly investigated our house doors (approaching and touching them) and are regularly coming under the house for extended periods, increasingly making us and our children uncomfortable getting to/from the car to go to school or work.","Active","Los Angeles",34.1734574,"-118.043341"

It claw's everything in its path when attempting to access  food.  We have all of our trash in giant enclosures however, it has constantly ripped the wooden doors off or damaged them repeatedly. Or it tips over the cooking oil that was in a sealed container on our loading dock and eats that for a while. Which creates a tripping/slipping hazard for my staff and residents. The bears can be seen at times roaming the campus which also is safety hazard because this is a senior facility and residents don't move that fast to get to safety from the bears path. Please can anything be done? Mabey relocate the bears to a new habitat away from civilization and especially a senior facility. Because within the past year they have gotten very comfortable an brave around humans. I just don't want anyone to get hurt on the property that could have been avoided.

He just went 50 feet away laid down with a can of food he had left near the house and could not be scared off. A El Dorado sheriff deputy arrived and surveyed the damage. While my wife and I were out of town our home was hit. Every window had its screen torn off. Every door and window had muddy paw prints and one window and window covering was broken, and destroyed. The only reason he didn't get into the house was the one window he broke was too small for a large bear to get through. Several weeks ago we noticed another neighbor on our street was broken into with their screens mangled and one door was broken into. Yesterday, I was having my garage door fixed and the repairman said he saw a large black bear walking down the street.

On December 4th or 5th  2021, we had a bear breakthrough our front door and pillage our house as can be seen in attachment 1 and 2. We were notified by our contractor that was replacing our carpet and flooring on Monday December 6th in the morning.  The bear destroyed our front door and busted out the door jamb to the hall bathroom. Additionally, the bear bent drawer guides, damaged cabinets, and removed a drawer completely from the cabinet. As result of rummaging through both our cabinets and fridge/freezer, the bear left a large mess.  During his efforts to go through our front door, he broke our front railing by pushing against it, as seen in the pictures.  All of the doors at the house were locked and the windows were closed and locked also.  That day we worked cleaning up the mess and securing our house by using plywood on the inside and outside of our door to strengthen the door and reinforce the door jam as applicable to hopefully avoid an additional intrusion.   On the night of December 6th, 2021, the bear returned.  We received the phone call from our contractor @ 8am on December 7th.  This time he broke the door jamb for the front door completely out. Please see the attachment labeled Bear 4. He went through the kitchen again and into the garage to rummage into a freezer/refrigerator located in the garage.  Once again we arrived to clean up the house and attempt to secure the front door again.  We replaced the door jamb using upgraded longer screws and new wood as applicable.    We also have attempted to deter the intrusions by spreading ammonia around the entrances and leaving a vented ammonia bottle by the front door.  We created a tack board that we placed in front of the front door.  In addition to this, we attached some bungee cords to the front of our front deck walkway to appear as a electric deterrent with a caution sign.   Early in the morning on December 8th, 2021 the bear returned to my neighbors house located at 3080 Meadowbrook and broke his front door down and pilfered his house.  His security cameras were able to capture pictures of the bear @4am in the morning leaving his house  See attachment #5  There are other houses on Meadowbrook Drive that have plywood covering their front doors that I assume are from similar activities.  For these reasons I believe that this bear is extremely destructive and dangerous.  The damage that has been done is extensive and it is matter of time until someone is seriously hurt.

"WIR-2021-004696","12/4/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","On 12-4-2021, at approximately 0411 hours, Wildlife Officer Torres received a call from NORCOM.  Porterville PD had received calls of something crashing through backyards between North 2nd and North 3rd Streets in downtown Porterville. Porterville PD units responding to the area observed a large bear in the yard of 531 N. 3rd Street, and the bear quickly climbed up into a 50’ tall Cypress Tree. WO Torres sent a text message to Lieutenant Barnhart and Wildlife Biologist Evan King at 0418 hours advising of the incident. Evan King responded to the text at 0425 hours stating he was assigned to and working a special pheasant hunt at Mendota Wildlife Area and was not able to respond. WO Torres spoke to Porterville PD who confirmed the bear was in the Cypress Tree and there was no immediate threat to public safety, however they did say the location is one block from the annual Christmas Parade route which was due to begin in a few hours. Wildlife Officer Lutz is the only drug certified officer in the 4220 Squad, and he was on scheduled vacation. WO Torres was able to reach WO Lutz who agreed to respond despite being on vacation, having family in town, and having plans for the day. WO Torres, WO Lutz, and Lieutenant Barnhart all responded to 531 N. 3rd Street. All three officers arrived between, 0515 and 0525 hours. Kern County Wildlife Biologist “Abby” was also contacted by WO Torres, and she advised she was assigned to a special quail hunt and could not respond either.  Lieutenant Barnhart made the decision to dart the bear and relocate it due to its location in the middle of a city, proximity to a parade route, and no clear avenue to return to bear habitat. These plans were also relayed to Wildlife Biologist King.   The bear was approximately 36’ up a thick Cypress Tree located in the yard of 531 N. 3rd Street. The tree overhung into the yard of the residence to the south of 531 N. 3rd Street. That residence had a Volkswagen Beatle and utility trailer parked in the driveway under the branches of the tree. Lieutenant Barnhart instructed WO Torres to knock on the door of the residence and advise the resident of the situation and have him move the vehicle and trailer. The resident stated the Volkswagen does not run but we could try to push it out of the way. We were able to move the utility trailer into the front yard of the residence and push the Volkswagen down the driveway so that it wouldn’t be under the limbs of the tree. No other items of concern or danger were noticed at this time.   Porterville PD contacted Porterville FD and they said their large ladder truck was non-operational and they didn’t have any other apparatus that would reach that height. Additionally, due to the layout (small, narrow tight driveway, fence lines, proximity of the tree trunk to the fence, etc) there was no room to place any sort of inflatable device to help catch the bear.   WO Lutz attempted to dart the bear twice. Both shots were ineffective, as the shots were difficult due to the thickness of the tree canopy. One of the Porterville PD Officers is a drone pilot. He recorded hound dog sounds on the drone and flew the drone above the tree in an attempt to haze the bear lower into the tree where an easier dart shot could be made, and the fall would minimal. This was ineffective. Lieutenant Barnhart utilized a pepper ball gun to try to haze the bear into coming down lower, but this had the opposite effect and the bear moved into thicker canopy. Officers waited until the bear eventually moved a little lower into the tree (back to approximately 30-35’), and into a small canopy opening.  WO Lutz only had one vial of drug left, so assistance was requested from Tulare County Animal Control who had arrived on scene with their own dart gun and drug inventory. The animal control officer was able to make an effective shot and the bear was immobilized at 0739 hours. Prior to being completely immobilized, the bear moved to the south side of the tree where it overhung the driveway where the Volkswagen had been parked earlier.   The bear fell out of the tree from about 30-35’ and caught itself on numerous branches on the way down slowing its fall from the tree. There was a privacy fence that separated the two properties, so as the bear fell, Wildlife Officers began quickly moving around the fence towards the driveway of the neighboring residence. As they approached the bear, officers noticed a floor jack that had been right up against the backyard fence and the jack handle of the jack had impelled the bear. Wildlife Officer Torres observed that the jack handle only went though the skin and fatty portion of the rear hindquarters and appeared to have missed muscle and all vital organs. The bear was rolled onto its side and the jack handle was carefully removed from the bear. Wildlife Officer Torres inspected the jack handle and noted that there was no blood on the handle, confirming that the handle appeared to only go through the skin and fatty portions of the bear.   Lieutenant Barnhart assessed the vitals and condition of the bear and noted that it was breathing, the respiration rate was normal, and the bear had eye movement. Lieutenant Barnhart also inspected the area where the jack handle had impelled the bear and observed that the wound appeared to be more superficial and there was almost no blood around the wound site. The bear weighed approximately 250 lbs, and appeared to possibly be an older bear.   The bear was carefully loaded into the back of Lieutenant Barnhart’s patrol vehicle using a litter. Barnhart reassessed the health of the bear and noted that it still had a normal respiration rate and normal eye movement. The bear was ear tagged with a red “do not consume” ear tag #82. The bear was painted with bright white spray paint with a crossed out “0” indicating DO NOT SHOOT.   During the immobilization and assessment, it appeared that two or three residents were using cell phones to photograph or record the incident. No negative comments were overheard, and Lieutenant Barnhart made sure to advise the residents that the bear was alive, appeared to be okay, and would be transported to the forest for release.   Lieutenant Barnhart transported the bear to the Sequoia National Forest for release at 0755 hours. The area that was selected is part of the Windy Fire Closure area, thus minimizing the chances of the bear being harvested by a hunter. Barnhart arrived at the designated release location at 0931 hours and bear had his head up and was alert upon arrival. Barnhart lowered his tailgate and waited for the bear to fully recover from the immobilization drugs. At 0958 hours, the bear jumped from the bed of the truck and began slowly walking away. Barnhart noted that the bear was mobile and using all four legs without any issues. Barnhart remained with the bear until approximately 1030 hours, at which time the bear had walked about 150 yards from the patrol vehicle and was even able to traverse uneven terrain without any issues.","New","Tulare",36.0753525,"-119.014285"

No direct contact with my horses that i know of with certainty, but a nightly threat to them. (Couldn’t change anything in the above part of the form to reference that).   Hello I am writing about a bear in the Pasadena area. I know it’s home to them and it’s part of life here. But the location I house my horses at has been having an issue with a bear for the past few weeks. He has repeatedly broken into storage sheds, stall areas,  even though any attractant has been removed. I have had my horses there for 12 years and never had a problem with a bear at all, though they have been spotted in the area and even at the property. And prior to me there have been horse there for almost 40 years. Nothing is any different at the property now than over those past 12 years. We have tried motion alarms and motion lights and the bear continues to destroy things every night. I worry about the safety of my horses, especially hearing there’s a bear in nearby neighborhoods killing goats. I am unsure if he has directly contacted the horses, but what he is doing is spooking them and may cause them to injure themselves. This to me doesn’t seem to be a “bear problem” as much as a “problem bear”. And yes I know they are more desperate due to the fires, but I can’t continue to have property damage, and threat to my horses because of it. What if anything can be done.

"WIR-2021-004669","11/29/2021 0:00","Black Bear","General Nuisance","This is not just ONE incident. We have an adult female black bear that has been visiting our property (Cold Spring Tavern at 5995 Stagecoach Rd., Santa Barbara in the middle of the Los Padres National Forest) nearly every night for quite some time. I am pretty sure it has been the same bear. No tag was spotted. We long ago implemented continual precautions (emptying trash nightly and using protected dumpsters that are thoroughly cleaned with bleach every week).   In the beginning (before 2020), this bear was raiding less often and usually at night when no one was on the property. The bear has come around much more frequently and has become more bold and aggressive in the last year or so. On repeated occasions she has been spotted by staff or customers near the tavern during evenings or late afternoons. We have scared her off by making noise but she soon returns. Early last summer she had a cub following her but we have not seen the cub since last fall.  The reason I have waited until now to report this bear is that she seemed more a nuisance than a threat as long as we were aware of her. But a few incidents lately have me worried. About a month ago our maintenance man arrived early in the morning and was confronted by the bear. He had to jump back in his car for safety, sitting inside until the bear lost interest. The bear has also clawed at two of our buildings, nearly breaching one door. She also destroyed a linens bin near the kitchen door. Our restaurant is over 150 years old and can't take the brunt of her power on a wall, let alone a door. I feel one little push will gain her access to the whole interior of the restaurant. She has also roamed around our outdoor patio soon after closing. One evening in the summer of 2020 we had a wedding reception in the garden. The bear came very close to the guests and lingered just above the garden on a hill. Of course many of the guests were delighted and wanted to get closer, not understanding the danger in which they put themselves. My brain was screaming ""Liability!"".     We gave permission for a hunter to take out a male bear last September 10th that was even more aggressive than the female. While tracking the bear he located a den on our property. The female is surely coming from this nearby den. I am worried that an employee or customer could be in danger if caught unaware or if they allow curiosity to put them in danger.   Please advise me on a next step. I am at wits end. Thank you.","Active","Santa Barbara",34.5220212,"-119.8396738"

In his absence over several weeks, a bear has damaged the outside of the cabin in an attempt to enter.  The animal had managed to make entry into the cabin and destroyed property inside as well.  The RP explained the following in his email:  We have done our best to remove anything which we believe emits attractive smells.  We have tried banging pans and throwing rocks at the bear to hopefully discourage it.  We have spread cayenne pepper around the exterior of the cabin.  We have placed frequently replenished containers of ammonia around the exterior and interior of the cabin.  We have put moth balls around the exterior of the cabin.  We have placed bear boards (boards with nails driven through, nails facing upward) at strategic locations around the exterior.  Unfortunately the bear has learned that cabins can be food sources and in spite of our efforts to discourage it, it continues to attack our cabin.  In fact, it seems to be getting worse.  During the last 4 nights, the bear has torn through the side of the cabin and gained  access 3 nights.  Biologist Rebecca Barboza discussed the matter with the RP on 11/16.

"WIR-2021-004381","8/27/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","On Friday 8/27/21 at approximately 1300 hours, I, Lt. Kyle Kroll, received a call forwarded by Plumas County Sheriff’s Office. The call was regarding a person, later identified as Anthony Rios, who was allegedly bitten by a bear. I was in contact with Plumas District Hospital staff, who informed me that a subject had been admitted to the hospital the previous night for a foot wound. The hospital staff informed me that Rios thought he had been bitten by an animal while he was sleeping, but the information was not corroborated and could not be determined, and no animal contact report or call to CDFW was made that night. Hospital staff treated Rios's wound and released him early that morning (8/27/21).  That next afternoon, while on his way to pick up antibiotics for his foot, Rios returned to the hospital. He showed hospital staff pictures of fresh bear tracks directly below the location where he had been sleeping in his pop-out trailer. Rios explained that he had gone back to sleep upon returning to his camp, but discovered the evidence that morning when he woke up. The hospital staff, realizing that the wound was likely a bear bite, told Rios he needed to receive the rabies vaccine treatment. Hospital staff began the animal bite notification process, contacting Plumas County.  On 8/27/21 at approximately 1330 hours, I spoke to Rios by phone. Rios explained to me that late the previous night (early morning of 8/27), at approximately 0030 hours, what he believed to be an animal had bit him through his pop-out camp trailer siding. It should be noted that Rios was camping on his property at the time of the incident, and sleeping in his travel camp trailer. The trailer is hard sided, but has a canvas type ""pop-out"" sleeping quarters area. Rios explained that his foot was inside of his sleeping bag, against the side of the canvas wall when he was bit. He explained he woke up screaming and bleeding. When he went outside of the trailer he did not see anything. Rios then went to the hospital for treatment, receiving 3 stiches on top of his foot, and 2 stiches on the bottom. Rios relayed that he came back to his property after leaving the hospital, and went back to bed. When he woke up later that morning, he discovered fresh bear tracks in the dust, and a bite mark in the canvas side of his trailer. Rios took photographs of the evidence, and took them to the hospital to show the staff.   Wildlife Officer Zeke Awbrey responded to the incident location of 1645 Old Big Creek Road in Meadow Valley. Awbrey spoke with Rios about the details of the incident. Awbrey confirmed fresh bear tracks in the dust below the trailer bite location. He photographed the scene and Rios's foot (see photographs). Awbrey collected DNA swab evidence of the canvas bite mark on the trailer siding. Awbrey explained to me that Rios then left the property to receive his rabies vaccine series.   I then responded to the location with USDA Wildlife Services Agent Mark Bentz, arriving at approximately 1740 hours. Bentz and I located fresh bear tracks in the dust at the trailer, and what appeared to be a bite mark in the canvas side of the trailer. The size of the bite was consistent with that of a black bear canine teeth puncture. We photographed the scene.   On Monday August 30th, I transported the DNA swab sample Officer Awbrey had collected to the Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Sacramento. The sample consisted of an exterior swab of the bite mark on the canvas side of the trailer. The forensics lab processed the swab sample, and received a positive identification on a black bear.     CDFW chain of command determined that a culvert trap would be placed at the incident location to catch the now DNA identified offending black bear.   On Tuesday 8/31/21, USDA Agent Bentz placed a bear culver trap at the location of the incident. No bear was successfully caught.   On Thursday September 2nd, it was determined that the bear trapping attempt would cease, and the trap was removed from the premises.  No further action was taken.","Active","Plumas",39.9212245,"-121.074548"

I responded to the Tahoe Forest Hospital in Truckee, CA where the victim had been taken by ambulance. I met with the victim’s husband who identified himself as Mario Curzi. He stated his wife, Laurel Rose Von Hoffman-Curzi had been attacked around 0600 hours that morning in their vacation home at the above address. Mario said he awoke to his wife screaming and blood all over the house. He then observed the back part of the bear exiting the house. Mario believed the front door may have been shut, but unlocked.  I spoke with Laurel Rose. She gave details of the attack. She stated at around 0600 hrs, she heard a commotion in the kitchen and opened her adjacent bedroom door to investigate. She indicated she saw a large bear she described as dark brown to black in her kitchen. The bear charged at her, stood up on its hind legs and swatted at her one time with each of its front paws. L. Rose said the bear was as tall as her, 5’9” when standing on its hind legs. She told me the bear did not immediately flee the house, but rather stayed and was looking around as if it was hesitant to leave the house and food. She said she screamed and tried to scare the bear. She then threw a blanket at the bear, which caused it to leave the house. Her husband and son came out from their bedrooms.  Laurel Rose removed the bandages from her face. I noticed an approximate two-inch laceration from about her right cheek bone to the right corner of her mouth. She also had a laceration to her abdomen and scratches on her chest and arm. Laurel Rose later told me she discovered more bruises and scratches on her body after she left the hospital.   I went to 260 Pino Grande Avenue where I met with the victim’s son, Michael Curzi, who told me he saw the bear exit the house during the incident. He described the bear as being at least 400 pounds. Michael showed me the upstairs where I saw a significant amount of blood spatter between the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. I saw food that had been pulled out of the refrigerator. Cardboard ice cream containers had been removed from the freezer, chewed on, and scatted on the floor. I collected the ice cream containers and what may have been some small bear hairs for DNA evidence. I also collected a fresh bear scat sample from the driveway. As I was leaving the house, a woman and a Placer County Sheriff Deputy flagged me over to say that a bear had broken into a neighboring house the night before. I followed them to 313 Snowflake Avenue, about three houses away from the site of the attack. I cleared the house with the deputy and found that the boarding on the back door had been broken off and a bear had come through the door window. Food items had been removed from the shelves and were scattered throughout the kitchen. I collected multiple bear hairs from the kitchen as DNA evidence. The homeowner said this has happened multiple times recently and that she had spoken to CDFW biologists about it.   I delivered the samples to Wildlife Incident Lab staff, relayed information continuously to my chain of command and arranged for the county trapper to set a trap the evening of 10/30/2021. The Wildlife Incident Lab staff were able to obtain a full DNA profile of the bear from the samples I collected.  On 11/07/2021 at approximately 0030 hours, an adult female bear and a yearling cub were caught in the culvert trap at 260 Pino Grande Avenue. The bears were transported to a California Department of Fish and Wildlife facility where their DNA was cross referenced with the DNA of the attacking bear. DNA analysis showed that neither of the caught bears matched the attacking bear. The two bears were released back into the wild on 11/07/2021. Trapping efforts have since been discontinued due to length of time to catch the offending bear.","New","Placer",39.2395681,"-120.0429121"

We wonder if he may have been displaced by the recent wildfires. We have taken measures to dissuade him from returning, making sure all trash and recycling is securely put away. Baited hot capsicum pepper honey to dissuade him, it did not work. Sadly, he has quickly become habituated to not fear people and is now often trying to break into our two homes. The moment our dog is not present, the bear takes the opportunity to try to break into our two houses on the property. We have lived on this property for 18 years and have had encounters with wildlife including bear and mountain lion. This bear is sadly becoming  problematic.  He has entered two homes on our property a total of three times in the past month. He has been munching our veggie garden, grapes and fruit trees the past months. First house incident several weeks (5-6) ago, he gained access into our primary residential house by tearing off a plastic cat door and climbing through the cat door to access cat food inside a mud room. He then tore off another cat door into the main area of the house, went into the kitchen, opened cabinets to find a bag of dog food. We think our cat accidentally knocked something over and spooked the bear out. Second incident was in another rental dwelling, when tenant went away a few days, and left a window cracked open. The bear opened the window, climbed into the house and tore off the kitchen cabinets, emptying contents. Third incident at primary house the one day no one and the dog were not present Sunday 10/24/21, we returned and saw evidence that he was scratching and biting at the mud room door, trying to gain access into the house again. He is larger in size now and is no longer able to fit through the cat door. He went to a nearby storage shed, ripped the latch and door molding off and gained access into it, though no damage inside as there was nothing of interest for him there. Our property has a lot of human activity five days a week as we are a small working licensed farm. Our five employees and tenants are often seeing and hearing the bear around, it seems to be almost a daily presence. They do not keep food or trash outside that would attract him. People have used blow horns and yelled and banged pots and things to try to scare him off, but is not very frightened of people. When spooked, he runs to a nearby tree and climbs it, rather than running away. He once chewed a garden irrigation line, wrestled with a watering cube, and chewed on an extension cord, and has unsuccessfully tried to gain access to our secure trash shed.  I am contacting our closest neighbors to ask about their experiences with this bear as I have heard that they also have had encounters.

Dailey of two bears stuck in a car at Crowley Lake in Mono County.  I contacted Surcom Dispatch and received the R.O. of the car and told them I would be responding.  I contacted Warden Peabody and asked him to go with me to assist.  We arrived at the Crowley Lake residential area about 0730 HRS.  We found a 2011 Red Honda Pilot (CA license plate #6HJL016) parked on the north side of Pearson Road.  We looked inside the windows, which were very hard to see through and found two bears who were sleeping.  As we were standing outside the vehicle, the two bears began to become very active inside the vehicle.  The sow appeared to be approximately 200 lbs and the cub was approximately 75 lbs both black in color.   Warden Peabody and I both decided to tie a rope onto the door handle of the Honda Pilot and pull the door open to release the bears.  Warden Peabody tied the rope onto the door handle while I pulled my patrol vehicle up close to the door of the Honda Pilot not allowing the door to open while Warden Peabody tied the rope to the door handle.  I then backed up and Warden Peabody pulled the door open.  The sow and cub came out of the Honda Pilot and then tried to climb over a wood fence approximately 5 foot tall.  Both bears eventually made it over the fence.  The bears were now in the back yards of trailers in a trailer park.  We drove around to the front of the trailers where the bears were now.  The sow immediately got into a trash can and started eating trash.  We yelled and tried to get the bears to run off, but they did not want to leave.  As Warden Peabody and I got closer, the sow turned toward us and made a couple of steps in my direction.  I fired one bean bag round just under her chin into the front of one of her legs.  The bear turned and ran off.  Both bears made it back over the fence and ran off towards the south.  We drove around the neighborhood looking for the bears but were no longer able to locate.  We then went back to the R.O.’s residence at 135 Wind Drift Rd, Crowley Lake, CA and left a business card. At approximately 1300 HRS, Nathan Liuag called me on my cell phone and told me he was the owner of the Honda Pilot.  He told me he saw the damage and realized it was from a bear.  I asked if he had left any type of food in the vehicle and all he could think of was possibly a cup of coffee that had honey in it but was not sure.  The car was too destroyed to find any food left behind. Mr. Liuag did not request a depredation permit.","Active","Mono",37.5669577,"-118.7405645"

The bear is a typically size adult who has been going through trash cans (which we've warned neighbors not to set out overnight) and breaking up fruit trees.  At 2PM on Oct 15, I encountered another bear.  It was a much larger bear.  By far the largest I have encountered in over 28 years living with bears in the area.  It was eating pomegranates from a tree next to my driveway.  I got an airhorn and blasted it as previously instructed by your department.  The sound had little effect on the large bear.  It is definitely very comfortable in the neighborhood.  Then, as I turned the corner to go to the back of the house, I encountered a cub scurrying away.  We have at least 3 bears in the neighborhood.  The two adults are very comfortable around humans.  They have also been breaking up fruit trees.  Last night, they broke the top out of a 20+ year old apple tree.  Several months ago, I had to strip all of the fruit off of two of my three avocado trees (20 year old trees) because the bears were breaking them up.  There are children, pets, and the elderly in the area.  Something needs to be done about bears that have become this comfortable.

Mr. Goddard said that he had a horse and 2 dogs ""tore up"" by what he believes to be a bear because he knows that there has been a bear nearby going through peoples trash.  When I asked him if the injury could have been made by a mountain lion, he told me no because ""mountain lion don't do that"".

It’s broken into her neighbor’s apartment (that is adjoined to hers) 3 times and it’s freaking her out. She’s lived in Mammoth for almost a decade and has been an employee of mine on and off at Parchers Resort she’s very used to bears but this is a problem bear. The attack on the dog was because it charged my friend and her leashed dog when she went up to close her neighbor’s door not knowing that there was bear in the house and the dog got in the middle of the bear and her. Apparently its den is under a house across the street on forest lawn and it has a cub and neither care at all about people or dogs. She called Mammoth PD and they said they no longer relocate bears so if it becomes a nuisance they may have to euthanize them but it’s a lot of paperwork. She really doesn’t want the bear to be put down but this seems like a legitimate safety issue.    She isn’t really sure what to do. I know Mammoth loves its bears but do you have any thoughts on how she should proceed? Just call the PD after every incident?

I went to the back yard and observed the top of our chicken coop torn apart, chicken food vaults ripped open and 5 piles of bear scat in the back yard. The Rubbermaid container that housed back up chicken food and bird seed was torn open and seed scattered. I installed motion detector lighting on chicken coop and reinforced the top of the coop with heavy duty cattle wire and placed the food vaults in a shed. On the evening of 10/5 at 8:00 pm, the motion detection lighting illuminated and our two border collie dogs became alarmed and ran out the dog door, directly to the chicken coop. We turned on the back yard flood light and observed a sow bear outside of the coop, with her two cubs trapped inside the coop.  I shown my spot light on the sow bear and yelled many times to retrieve the dogs from their agitation. The sow bear climbed back over our perimeter fence to escape the commotion, leaving her two cubs trapped in the chicken coop. After 5 minutes of me observing the surroundings, I approached the chicken coop and the cubs ran up the pine tree that centers the coop.  I opened the gate to the chicken coop to let the cubs leave once I left the scene.

"WIR-2021-003755","9/26/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","Hello! I reported several weeks ago about an area in Pine Mountain Club up on Chestnut Court wherein I have seen up to 9 bears at a time on a small property shared by two homes. With about 85% certainty, you can drive up that street and see at least 4-5 bears on any given evening around 7pm. It has seemed strange that so many bears hang around there and sleep/rest within feet of the homes and cars while both home owners are home. On 9/26/21, I found 4-5 bears up there but this time all bears were in a very small area with their noses to the ground and appeared to be eating. As I filmed this footage, a woman walked into the shot from the right with her dog (appeared to be a border collie perhaps). She was within 10 feet of the feeding bears and was very casual with her dog who was non-reactive to the bears. My footage doesn't capture her feeding the bears, but it would be impossible for her to have walked past 4-5 huge bears eating together within a few feet of her and her dog and she not notice. There also couldn't possibly be an ongoing natural feeding source in this one tiny location every night for the entirety of summer. She walked into the shot from the right, which would be coming from 15024 Chestnut Court, Pine Mountain Club, CA 93222 but she could also be living at the home at 15020 Chestnut Court, Pine Mountain Club, CA 93222. I believe those are the only two home on the property I am referring to. I will attach the video footage and a still photo from the video of the woman with the bears visible in the back, eating.

The apple tree was just a few feet from the back corner and the canopy of the tree went over her neighbors’ fence and also her back fence with is undeveloped public property.  I could only see 1-2 apples in the tree.  I noticed a wood fence on RP Crafts’ property next to the tree that had approximately 5 of the boards broken off at the top horizontal 2x4 which was approximately 5 feet off the ground.  The neighbors back fence also had 4-5 broken boards at the top 2x4 that were broken off.  I also found scratch marks on the tree truck and branches that were consistent with bear claw marks.  No footprints or other types of sign of a bear was found. I again suggested to RP Craft, that she clean up any apples still left and look into the electric fence.  She told me she would do that.

I think the bear is a male, but I'm not positive on that account.  First, I've been in the area since 1989, and so I've obviously had a number of run-ins with bears over the years.  Generally I can yell, bang pots and pans, use ammonia/pinesol, throw rocks, etc. and, over time, persuade the bear to leave my house alone.  But this bear is different.  The first incident was that the bear broke into my dad's neighbor's house and made itself a nice meal out of what was in the fridge.  That's nothing too out of the ordinary.  Then, multiple times, the bear got into my dad's car.  We are quite diligent about keeping our cars clean and perceptive of smells in the vehicle--we use Tough Stuff to dissuade vehicle entrance.  But this bear keeps opening my dad's car.  He leaves the door unlocked to prevent damage.  Next up, it got into my brother's van and did some minor damage.  Then, a few weeks later, it RIPPED THE DOORS OFF! of my wife's car, broke two windows, ripped up the trunk, and chewed up the back seat.  And then, a few weeks later, it ripped the gas door off of my truck, ripped open the Tonneau Cover, and dented and scratched the truck all up.  I understand clearly that bears, in general, enter vehicles because there is food or something that smells like food.  That is not the case with this bear.  There wasn't so much as a pine needle in the bed of my truck when it ripped that open.  And why the gas door?  Too, my wife's car was clean as a whistle.  It was evident that it was trying to get into the trunk and failed, but there wasn't so much as a wrapper in the trunk.  Is there anything that can be done to remove this particular nuisance animal?  Is there anything more aggressive that I can do than throw rocks at it?  Thanks,  Ben Botto 916-287-3347","New","El Dorado",38.8683202,"-120.0387474"

We have blocked the sections around the top and it is still getting in.  We do not have a bear proof bin because the weight of the lid is too heavy for our kitchen staff to lift and throw the food into at the same time (6 yard dumpster). The bear is chewing up the lids on the dumpster and bowing the lids so they collapse into the dumpster.  Also makes a mess with the trash.

"WIR-2021-003309","9/5/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","(Warden Johansen's Report) On 9-6-2021, I was notified of a wildlife incident that occurred in Mammoth Lakes involving a black bear and a juvenile. I responded to the scene of the incident (380 Chapparal Way, Mammoth Lakes) with Warden Peabody. While enroute to Mammoth Lakes, we reviewed the hospital report that had been forwarded to us and made multiple attempts to contact the victim’s family using two phone numbers provided in the hospital report. The phone numbers listed did not work, and the Mono County Sheriff’s Department had no record of the incident on file, nor any telephone numbers that were associated with the victim’s name or address. I used the CDFW ALDS (automated license data system) in an attempt to locate a name or phone number for somebody living at the residence, but no record was on file.  I contacted three residents who live at 380 Chaparral Way and asked each if they had heard about an incident involving a black bear and a juvenile. One neighbor told me he had heard about the incident, and the family involved lives in unit 3. This neighbor told me he sees many different bears in the parking lot on a regular basis. I knocked on the door of unit 3 multiple times but was unable to contact any of the residents. I left a business card with my name and phone number, and instructions to call me regarding the bear incident.   On 09-08-2021, I received a phone call from a woman identifying herself as Jaime Mora, the older cousin of the victim who was involved in the bear interaction. Mora told me that she helps care for her cousin, whose last name is “Lerma”. She told me in summary that:  At around 11:30-11:40 on the 5th of September, the victim (a 13-year-old male) was in the parking lot of his housing complex at 380 Chapparal Way and talking on the phone with his grandmother. He walked by a set of 2 dumpsters attempting to meet his grandmother somewhere in the parking lot. He did not have any trash with him but happened to walk by two trash dumpsters. He saw what he described as a medium sized bear at the dumpster, so he walked away. The victim was unable to describe the color of the bear. While his back was turned, he was hit from behind and knocked to the ground by what he believed was the bear. The victim received a scratch on his back that appears to be consistent with a bear claw and received injuries to his knee that resulted from the fall.  Jaime Mora then took her cousin to the hospital where he received treatment for his wounds. While speaking with Mora, she agreed to send me a picture of the wounds the juvenile had received. Mora told me that she still had the juvenile’s shirt that he was wearing during the time of the incident and would give it to the CDFW for evidence purposes. Mora told me that her cousin is somewhat traumatized and afraid to go outside during the nighttime. Mora told me that based on the events that took place near the dumpster, it is possible that the victim startled the black bear, and it was not necessarily acting in an aggressive manner.  (Warden Dishion's Report) On 09-09-2021, I was asked by OIC Chad Elliott to contact Jaemy Mora in Mammoth Lakes to investigate a bear incident.  I called Jaemy Mora and asked her if I could come by to look at the incident location and to get information on what had happened.  At approximately 1100 HRS, I arrived at the bear incident location and interviewed Jaemy Mora. The victim Anthony Lerma was at school at this time.  Jaemy Mora is Anthony Lerma's cousin, and she takes care of Anthony Lerma.  Neither of Anthony Lerma's parents live with him.     I asked Jaemy Mora to explain to me what had happened, and this is what she told me:   On 09-05-2021 at approximately 2330 to 2340 HRS, Anthony Lerma, a 13-year-old male (06-26-2008) was walking from his residence at 380 Chaparral #3, Mammoth Lakes in Mono County to his grandmother approximately two blocks away on Sierra Nevada Rd.  As he reached the street of his apartment complex, he reached two trash dumpsters back-to-back with approximately 6-8 feet between them.  The south dumpster had its lid open, and the north dumpster was closed.  Anthony Lerma was talking to his grandmother on his cell phone while he was walking.  When he reached the north-east corner of the northern dumpster, he saw a bear, described as ""medium in size"" inside the south dumpster approximately 10 feet away.  Anthony Lerma then turned and started to walk quickly, not run, back to his apartment.  While his back was turned, the bear (presumably) ""hit him"" from behind leaving a scratch on this back.  Anthony Lerma fell to the ground scraping his knee on the pavement.  He then began to scream for help and the bear ran away.  Jaemy Mora told me she took her cousin to the hospital where his wounds were cleaned (no stitches were required).  Jaemy Mora gave me the victims shirt which will be sent to the Wildlife Lab in Rancho Cordova.     Two of the scratch marks on his back started approximately in the middle of his back and went to his belt line.  There was a third scratch mark that was much smaller and faint to the right of his back and approximately 6-8 inches long.  The three scratch marks were parallel and about 3-4 inches apart.    Warden Brian Johansen also talked with Jaemy Mora on 09/08/21 after the incident.  Jaemy Mora told Warden Johansen the same story.  She also told Warden Johansen that her cousin (the victim) is somewhat traumatized and afraid to go near the dumpsters.  He is constantly looking over his shoulder and does not want to go outside at night.     After I spoke with Jaemy Mora, one of her neighbors in the apartment complex, who could not speak English, explained through Jaemy Mora as an interpreter, that he has been seeing two bears in the area.  He said the two bears are very similar in appearance, medium in size, about 300 pounds and brown in color.  He first started seeing these bears on 09-05-2021, the day of the incident.  The bears are eating out of the dumpsters when the lids are left open.","Active","Mono",37.6425825,"-118.972867"

The first encounter was via the kitchen/dining room area window. The said bear attempted to enter through the window with the swamp cooler. The bear was no successful but attempted. The bear has been showing up each night and progressively attempting to gain access more forcefully each time. The bear has continuously tried to access the residence by climbing up and pressing against the single pain windows. On 9/9/2021 what is described as a large over 500 pound black bear attempted to gain access to the front bedroom with two occupants residing inside. The occupants of the residence are two single moms and two children. When the occupant made visual contact with the bear, she was startled and began to yell and scream at it. The bear was not affected and was did not have the appearance it was at all scared of human contact and slowly made it's way to the rear of the house. The occupant could continuously hear the bear in and around the basement and back at the bedroom window. The occupant was advised to contact 911 and the Sheriff Office was not able to provide any services to help. The Occupants felt their life was in immediate danger and are familiar with the destructive behavior a bear can have if it wants to gain access into a residence. Two days prior the occupant had ""a bear"" unsure if it was the same bear break into her vehicle attempting to locate an article of food etc. None was found. The occupants house is under construction but there is no edible or consumable candles, food or other items drawing the animal to her residence. The bear has continuously been making contact between the hours of 10pm and 11pm. After roughly 11PM the bear follows the same trail downhill to a overgrown oak woodland area, quite possibly a den, I as one of the residences in the house am requesting a depredation permit to dispatch the bear, as needed in an emergency basis. I am a hunter and understand gun safety and hunting regulations. My facts from the encounters lead me to believe the bear is increasing its position in wanting to obtain access and I feel the residence, my son as one of them, have the potential to be harmed if he ""the bear"" does make entry. The house is small with only one exit. I have concerns of the safety of each occupant. The bear is described as approximately 400 to 500 pounds with front paw size of approximately 6-7 inches in length. Again my intentions of being granted a depredation permit to dispatch the animal is for safety and making sure if the animal is needed to be dispatched it is done correctly.

These bear cubs are highly habituated and NOT AFFRAID OF HUMANS OR HUMAN CONTACT.  When challenged by Adult with banging pots and pans and loud yelling, the bears were not afraid or concerned, and continued with their eating and foraging. At one point a cub stood up on its back legs either to better observe the noise or prepare to defend itself.  This is conjecture by me.  From the video I observed, and the story I heard, the bear cubs are probably orphaned because a mother bear has not been seen in the area for over two months.  It further appears the camp host, possibly a PG&E employee or docent, believes, like everyone else, the cubs are so cute, and it therefor not only tolerating the bear visits, but encouraging their continued presence and visitations.    I request F&G investigate to determine if the Bear Cubs pose a present potential danger to humans or are being groomed and intentionally habituated to human presence and exposure to the determined of the bears themselves.

I found large and small pieces of condensed paper materials (maybe paper towels), a piece of plastic bag that previously contained lettuce (read from nutrition facts), a waxy paper material, a small balled up piece of aluminum foil, and a remnant of plastic trash bag. This is leads me to believe the bear got into a neighbor's trash can. In addition, the feces contained numerous fig seeds and either fig skin or more trash (soft, fleshy). I estimate the weight of the feces to be around 20-50% trash by mass.  I have a bear-proof trash can, as do a few of my neighbors. Bears are pretty common in the neighborhood and have certainly gotten into many trash cans before. I will be informing my neighbors of the threats that trash consumption poses to bears as well as convincing them to get bear-proof trash cans. Hopefully this can limit the health risks of trash and educate people on living with bears. I am also interested in putting up signs at a nearby hiking trail (which I suspect bears come down from) to inform people of not leaving trash on the trail (there isn't a lot of trash, but still good practice to pick it up). Are there any particular resources that could be of help to the neighbors and hikers? Though this is the first time I have found trash in bear feces, I know that it has to be fairly common. I am concerned for the health of the bears and know that bear-proof trash cans do work. Thanks for your help in advance. My contact information is attached (better by email). I have pictures of the bear, feces, and trash.","Active","Los Angeles",34.2013289,"-118.1240386"

I contacted Travis the following morning and advised that I would be out there on 09/03/21 to conduct a follow up investigation regarding the dead black bear and to retrieve the carcass.   On 09/03/21 at 1130 hours, I arrived at 501 Cresent Street, Quincy, Plumas County.  Upon arrival I observed a large chicken coop surrounded by a 8 foot chain link fence.  The chicken perimeter was roughly 20x30 feet with a large 12x12 chicken house.  The perimeter of the property is also surrounded by a ten foot large metal fence. During my contact, Travis stated that the bear had been coming around during day and night hours attempting to eat the chickens but the dog had been chasing the bear away.  The problem was nightly for the past week.  He tried several times scaring the bear off with a pellet gun as well as the dog.  However, the bear changed its behavior and began to come during daylight hours when the chickens were walking around in the yard.   Travis stated that he was going to order a electric fence that week when the bear had entered the property on 09/01/21 at 2200 hours killing and eating 10 chickens.  He then shot and killed the black bear to protect the remaining chickens on the property.   Photographs of the damage fence, eaten chickens, feathers, bear tracks, bear scat, and torn barn door were taken as evidence.  The black bear was also removed from property.  A necropsy was conducted of the stomach contents and chicken feathers and parts were observed.    Travis stated that he would be purchasing a electric fence and paint ball gun to discourage any future bears from entering his property.","Closed","Plumas",39.9433858,"-120.9556289"

The bear was recorded on our home security video cameras and we observed the bear after it had already left our property.

The bear was large enough to scare the daylights out of my wife and daughter who never want to go outside at night again.  I believe it is a young/juvenile bear and maybe not fully grown.  I am reporting this because we live in Yucca Valley - about 15 minutes from Joshua Tree National Park.  It is high desert here, as you know, and we have neighbors who have lived here for decades have never seen a bear here - or have even heard of a bear here.  So it seems to be an unusual event.

The RP wanted to report a collared/ear-tagged bear (bear 040) breaking into her place of business and raiding the refrigerator between 6/25 and 6/27/21. Bear was collared on July 21, 2020, as part of the Mono County Black Bear Project, at Log Cabin Mine approximately 5 miles southwest of RP's property.  RP confirmed break-in with video surveillance footage sent to the investigator via text message.  The RP did not want a depredation permit but wanted to go on record to document this continued nuisance activity.  [Added by Taylor, Timothy on 6/28/2021]. Between 6/25 and 7/3/21, the bear has since broken into the main building six times. The first time, he ripped off the entire staff kitchen door and frame, which we replaced with some 2x4 and reinforced with locking bolts/screws. He ate approximately $50 worth of dry goods and nut milk. On the second occasion, he ripped off only the bottom section of the same door, which RO hasn't yet repaired. He got into some dry goods and peanut butter in the staff kitchen. The third and 4th times, he ripped off another piece of the same door and squeezed in between that door and another locked door. Again, RP replaced the wood he broke off and reinforced the door with locking bolts. The bear ate about $ 75 of frozen fruit and random items from the fridge each time. The 5th time the bear broke in, he ripped the door off the hinges. RP has since bolted that door shut and cannot use it until the $1500 replacement arrives. During early morning hours of 7/3/21, the bear ripped apart another door to gain access. This door will have to be replaced and is a custom rolling door, so RP estimated damage will cost $1000-2000. Overall, bear has caused approximately $3500 worth of property damage and food loss. [Added by Taylor, Timothy on 7/8/2021].  Depredation permit issued to RP was revoked on 7/13/21.  Instead investigator was directed by RGT to trap and relocate collared bear 040.  Bear was captured at around 030 hours on 7/16/21 at the RP's business, Mono Lake Shrimp Plant, US 395, Lee Vining, CA. Bear 040 was relocated approximately 50 airline miles north to the Slinkard Valley Wildlife Area in northern Mono County and released at approximately 1000.  Upon release bear was hazed with 6 bean bag rounds by Warden Dishon.   [Added by Taylor, Timothy on 7/19/2021] [Added by Taylor, Timothy on 7/19/2021] [Added by Taylor, Timothy on 7/19/2021].  Bear 40 returned to his original home range on around 7/22/21 based on GPS collar data.  Bear 40 was implicated in several campground incidents during August, mostly in lower Lee Vining campground.  On Friday, August 27 at around 2200, bear 40 was reported by RP Hillary Hansen to have broken into an employee trailer at the Mono Shrimp Plant by first breaking the door to get inside.  Once inside the bear broke trashed inside of the trailer and injured the tenants cat.  The tenant was outside the trailer when the bear broke on and could not get to her cat.  A copy of the vet bill was sent to the ES Taylor as well as pictures of the damage. The RP reported that the bear was collared and GPS data places bear 40 at the scene on Friday evening at around 2200.  The RP reported that bear 40 returned to her place of business on Saturday, August 28, at around 2000 but was scared off by the tenants.  As of August 30, bear 40 had moved south to lower Lee Vining canyon to the southeast portion of his known home range.   [Added by Taylor, Timothy on 8/30/2021]. On August 31, RGT, through the R6 Regional Manager, approved issuance of a lethal depredation permit for bear 40 to RP Hansen.

After seeing footage of bears in a similar location from multiple people, I decided to attempt to locate this active bear area. I found it! I've been to this area on at least 10+ occasions and every time I go there I see several bears hanging out at different times of day/evening. When I say hanging out, I mean that they are laying around, seem very relaxed, sleeping, cubs playing. They lay right next to people's cars, their propane tanks, next their homes. The houses are back off of the street a little so it's very hard to see what exactly is going on up there. I observed the bears to see why they might be lingering on these people's property. On a few occasions I have seen 5+ bears in these home's yards. I know better than to observe and leave them there so I will honk, make noise and yell for the bears to move along and while some of the bears move on hastily many do not respond to me at all and some don't even look in my direction. While I have done this on multiple occasions, the owners of the homes do not come out to address me or the bears. It would be unsafe of my to drive up their driveways and alert them with so many bears within feet of their homes. I believe there are only two homes on this little stretch of land and one of the homes did have a broken out window on it's deck which could have been from one of bears. It also appears that there might an electric fence on the property where most bears are hanging around. It seems very odd to me that so many bears would congregate in this one area daily for length periods of time. I am concerned that there is something drawing them here whether they are being intentionally fed or accidentally but often. The address I am providing is the house where the most bears hang around, but the bear hang out between the address provided and the house at this address :15020 Chestnut Ct, Pine Mountain Club, CA 93222. < This is the home with the broken out window.

On a few occasions I have seen 5+ bears in these home's yards. I know better than to observe and leave them there so I will honk, make noise and yell for the bears to move along and while some of the bears move on hastily many do not respond to me at all and some don't even look in my direction. While I have done this on multiple occasions, the owners of the homes do not come out to address me or the bears. It would be unsafe of my to drive up their driveways and alert them with so many bears within feet of their homes. I believe there are only two homes on this little stretch of land and one of the homes did have a broken out window on it's deck which could have been from one of bears. It also appears that there might an electric fence on the property where most bears are hanging around. It seems very odd to me that so many bears would congregate in this one area daily for length periods of time. I am concerned that there is something drawing them here whether they are being intentionally fed or accidentally but often. The address I am providing is the house where the most bears hang around, but the bear hang out between the address provided and the house at this address :15020 Chestnut Ct, Pine Mountain Club, CA 93222. < This is the home with the broken out window.  I am not sure if the owners of these homes can be talked to or the property can be looked at. I have footage of the bears on the property and can even grab other people's footage from the Facebook page if you would like it to demonstrate multiple accounts.","Closed","Kern",34.836836,"-119.1429985"

Bird feeder torn down, bird bath toppled, pool floats punctured, poop (looking unhealthy) on the turf. We did not see it but a neighbor two houses down captured good video of it also last night (8/16) foraging in a trash can. It looks young and is tagged on the ear. I couldn't make the number out clearly in the video, but it looks like it ends in either 39 or 59.  I have photos of the disturbed items (and poop). I don't possess the video and I think you have to be registered on the Next Door community where it was posted to see it, but I could probably get contact info or something for that neighbor.  The damage is negligible, but we (and many neighbors) really hope this bear can be relocated to a more suitable habitat since bears mixing with human neighborhood often ends poorly for the bears. We plan to bring in all our feeders tonight, but if someone was hoping to capture the bear in action, it seems likely he'll return since he was already here 2 nights in a row.

"WIR-2021-002733","7/15/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","At 11:36 AM on Friday, July 2nd 2021, I was notified by Tulare County Deputy Jason Baillie that there was a nuisance bear at Camp Whitsett. I notified Porterville dispatch that I would respond to the area. When I arrived at approximately 12:30 PM I spoke with the camp coordinator, Gary. The coordinator explained the following. Gary was notified by campers that there was a bear wondering around a campsite full of young children. The bear was evidently not afraid of humans. Gary responded to the area on a quad and attempted to scare the bear away by chasing it with the quad and yelling. The coordinator states that the bear barely lumbered away from him at a walking pace and even stopped and turned around several times. When Gary had pushed the bear far enough out of the camp area, he fired a single shot gun shell away from the camp and away from the bear in an attempt to further scare the animal off. He said the bear moved away but then wandered back closer to him, stopped about 10 yards away and laid down in shade. I asked Gary to bring me to where the bear was. I located the juvenile bear laying between two trees. The bear was approximately 50 yards from a nearby campsite. The bear was black with a white chest and identified as the same bear Gary attempted to scare off prior to my arrival. I noted the bear had what appeared to be a deer leg in its mouth. I waited for two Tulare County resident deputies to respond to the area. The following topics were reviewed between Camp Coordinator, Gary, resident Tulare County Deputy, Jason Baillie, and nearby resident Tulare County Deputy, Cliff Bush: •	The bear is a juvenile bear of approximately 150lbs. •	The bear has no fear of humans, load noises or motor vehicles. •	A reasonable attempt was made to scare the bear from the campground. •	The campground has approximately 100 children camping in close proximity to the bear. •	I know there is little to no water available due to drought conditions in the surrounding areas. •	I know the campsite has a pond as a water source. •	I know the bear made a recent kill of a fawn and was currently feeding on it.  •	I know the neighboring property raises goats. •	I know from training and experience that bears are highly intelligent and easily habituated to human food sources including livestock, trash, campsites and vehicles.  With the following information discussed between the group, I believe that I made the correct call to euthanize this bear. All individuals on scene agreed with this call for the following reasons: •	Even if we could scare the bear farther out of the area it would likely return and become a further nuisance due to the abundant food sources of barbeques, trash, local goat herd and small resident deer herd. •	The bear likely came to the area due to severe drought conditions causing traditional water sources to dry up and there is abundant water in the camp. •	The campsite is full children ranging from 6 – 16, of whom would remain in the vicinity for the next four days.  •	Leaving the brazen bear in this remote location, with no cellular service, no nearby law enforcement and medical resources, with young children and abundant food resources would be an unreasonable public safety risk and a liability for our department and for Tulare County Sherriff’s Office.","Active","Tulare",35.9991793,"-118.5407039"

"WIR-2021-002717","8/8/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Depredation","Investigation Narrative: On 08/08/21, at approximately 1307 hours, I received a call for service from Norcom Dispatch concerning a bear incident in South Lake Tahoe (Event number: 210808NORFW0090). Initial information provided a resident near South Upper Truckee Road and Memory Lane had shot a bear with a firearm and El Dorado County Sheriff Deputies had arrived on-scene. Later information provided EDSO had initially received the call for service at approximately 1241 hours that day resulting in case number: 21-6409.  I initiated a response to South Lake Tahoe from Placerville. While enroute, I received a call from EDSO Deputy Onstott, who advised the incident had occurred at: 3550 Memory Lane. Onstott provided there were possibly two cubs associated with the bear that had been shot, stating; the cubs had since dispersed from the residence. Onstott additionally provided a nearby resident had witnessed a bear traveling through the area that appeared to be wounded.  While enroute to South Lake Tahoe, I notified my immediate chain of command and requested assistance from wildlife management concerning assessment of the bear cubs. I arrived at: 3550 Memory Lane at approximately 1445 hours, where I met with EDSO Deputies Kirtchner and Onstott. Deputy Onstott advised she had already contacted the property owner, who was identified as: Richard Charshaflan. Deputies provided that Charshaflan had admitted to shooting a bear earlier that day at his residence with a shotgun slug. Deputies further advised the bear had entered a balcony surrounding the southside of Charshaflan’s residence when the incident occurred. Deputies advised there were no indications of a firearm projectile missing or exiting the bear. Deputies also provided it appeared two cubs likely associated with the incident had dispersed to a wooded hillside located West of the residence.  I walked onto the property and noticed there was a separate outbuilding located South of the residence. The North facing window to the outbuilding appeared to be broken and was open. While looking at the primary residence, I noticed what appeared to be the buildings’ front door. The front door was accessible from a balcony that extended alongside the south facing side of the building. There was a large window located left of the front facing side and/or West of the front door. During my initial assessment, I noticed there were many items surrounding the residence, including plastic garbage bags. Although this initial observation suggested possible attractants for bears, I found the items consisted largely of non-organic materials that would not be considered attractants.  I contacted Charshaflan and interviewed him on the South balcony where the incident had occurred. I audio recorded my interview. While discussing the outbuilding, Charshaflan indicated bears had broken the North facing window earlier that day before the shooting incident occurred. I asked Charshaflan if it was the same bear and he appeared un-certain. I later inspected and photographed the outbuilding and found the window had been broken. The broken window had been displaced and was inside the building upon the floor in front of the frame, suggesting it had been pushed from outside.  During my interview Charshaflan stated he was aware of bear activity in the area. Charshaflan indicated he had prepared himself with a firearm because of bear incidents in his community. While discussing the firearm, Charshaflan stated he possessed it for “protection”.   Charshaflan explained that prior to the incident he had heard “rustling”, “tumbling” and a “window crack”. Charshaflan said when he exited the building he saw the bear, stating; it “stood up”. Charshaflan described the initial contact as “scary”.  I then clarified that the bear had stood up on its hind legs and Charshaflan indicated yes. I asked Charshaflan if the bear was facing him while standing on its hind legs and he said yes. I asked Charshaflan which bear stood up and he indicated the adult bear he had shot, stating; he initially didn’t see the smaller bears, referencing the cubs.  I asked Charshaflan how far away the bear was from him, and he stated, it “seemed really close”, “I got scared”, “it may have been several feet away”. Charshaflan indicated the bear had been standing in front of the window when he exited the residence through the door. While determining approximate distance, I stood at the window and asked Charshaflan to stand where he had exited the residence. Charshaflan stood in front of the door, and I found the distance to be approximately 10 feet.  While standing in front of the window, I noticed an obvious crack in the glass; suggesting the cracking sound Charshaflan may have heard. I looked through the window and saw there were food items in plain view upon the countertop located on the other side of the glass. During this time, I also noticed a piece of watermelon and a small amount of bird seed on the deck’s railing. The watermelon and bird seed were in proximity of the window. Charshaflan stated he had placed the bird seed and watermelon for the birds. Based on my experience, the amount of watermelon and bird seed was consistent with someone feeding birds. However, I advised Charshaflan the bird seed and watermelon were an attractant for bears and asked his to discontinue the placement of any potential attractants.  During my interview, two bear cubs approached the residence from the West hillside previously referenced. The cubs entered the decking and stairway to the outbuilding. Both cubs then entered the outbuilding through the North facing broken window previously referenced.  When assessing Charshaflans’ reaction to the bear, I noted him to be an 83 year old individual, approximately 5’-6” and 142 pounds. This was based upon his appearance and drivers’ license information.  I concluded my interview with Charshaflan and initiated a search for the presumed sow with EDSO Deputies.  A blood trail was located East of the residence and extended Southeast across South Truckee Road and into a wooded area surrounding a creek drainage. An adult bear weighing approximately 250 lbs. was located upon a trail of blood and bear tracks. The bear was sitting up and exhibited labored breathing. I assessed the bear while looking through binoculars and was unable to verify a visible injury. As I continued to watch the bear, I found it’s body position and movements to be consistent with a severely injured animal. Upon speaking to Lt. B Pera, it was determined to immobilize the bear for further assessment.  I successfully hit the bear with an immobilization dart. The bear moved and was tracked a short distance. After approximately 15 minutes, the expected immobilization did not occur, and the bear was hit with an additional immobilization dart. Deputies and I waited approximately 5-10 minutes to pursue the bear following the second immobilization attempt.  The bear was located unresponsive in a shallow creek. I found the bear to be an adult female. As I was assessing the bear, I found there was a large wound to the upper back. The wound was located slightly left of the spine. I opened the wound and found it was approximately one inch in diameter. The wound channel extended into the upper chest area, with no visible exit wound. Based on my experience, the wound was consistent with a slug projectile fired from a shotgun. During this time, it was reasonable to conclude we had located the correct bear. It was also reasonable to conclude the bear had sustained an un-survivable injury.  During this time, I had coordinated with ES Megan O’Conner, who already arrived at 3550 Memory Lane and assessed the cubs. ES O’Conner determined the young bear were of sufficient age and size to survive on their own without intervention from the Department.  CDFW and EDSO Deputies departed the area at approximately 1815 hours. O’Connor and I re-located, where we took samples from the bear for further analysis.","New","El Dorado",38.8200404,"-120.0379958"

My husband sounded the bear horn that was next to our bed and the bear did not enter our house.  The only food visible was a bowl of lemons and limes. My family has owned this cabin since 1969 and our first bear break in was in 2019.  We always left food in the cabin but now we take every bit including salt and pepper when we leave. I had thought we were safe in the cabin while we were here but obviously not.  I am so very sad to have to get wires put up and live in a wire cage. The bear population needs to be managed by fish and game.","New","El Dorado",39.0186898,"-120.1213202"

He has been around at all hours of the day. He has been present while we were in our garden, unbothered by humans. We had to spray bear mace in his direction when airhorns didn't seem to intimidate him any longer. He has tried unsuccessfully entering our crawl space during one encounter. He has begun opening our garage door multiple times per week when he walks our property at night. He has finally destroyed our chicken coop and chickens after many attempts of breaking in,  we have 1 hen left. It has damaged fruit trees and fences in our garden area also. Our neighbors have witnessed it sleeping in their yard during the day and knocking over their trash cans. We've had fires above us in the last several years that has changed the behavior and frequency we see bears. This particular bear is young and we're sure we've seen it as a cub learning bad habits form its mom. Our concern is this young bear is only getting older and seems to be spending more time in the people places than we prefer. We have children at home and we are often outside, this bear has made us much less comfortable in our outdoor spaces as of recently.","New","Los Angeles",34.1483798,"-117.9493955"

I was told by the ICSO that a male adult had received a very minor cut on his face from a bear, and that when medical arrived on scene he had refused any medical treatment. I relayed to the ICSO to have the victim meet with me at the ICSO substation so I could interview him.   I met with the victim at approximately 0600 hours at the ICSO substation located in Lone Pine. The victim identified himself to me as Chris Dulmaine, DOB 4-11-1970. I observed a very minor cut on DULMAINE’s nose. DULMAINE gave me permission to photograph the cut and to swab the area for DNA evidence.    I asked DULMAINE what happened and he told me in summary that:   He had arrived very early to hike Mt. Whitney. He parked at the main parking lot and when he exited his vehicle to throw away some trash, he left his truck door open. When he came back to his truck, something struck him on the face. At first, he did not know what happened and he thought that maybe something inside of this vehicle fell on him and cut him. He took a few steps back and saw a bear exit his vehicle. The bear was small and he estimated it to be about 1 year old.    I asked DULMAINE if the bear was aggressive and he told me didn’t think so and that he was able to chase it away. Because of the low light conditions, DULMAINE was not able to give a clear description of the bear other than it was small in size.   When DULMAINE returned to his vehicle, he had inadvertently cornered the bear and startled it. Based on my training and experience, I believe that the reaction of the bear was defensive in nature and not at all aggressive. The fact that DULAMAINE was able to chase the bear away supports this.  I was not able to corroborate if the animal DULMAINE came into contact with was a bear or not, but based on the location and circumstances I do believe it was most likely a black bear.","Active","Inyo",36.5867468,"-118.2397572"

I was there to investigate someone shooting the night before in Four Jeffreys Campground possible to haze a bear or to shoot at a bear.  While parked on the side of the road, the host for Bishop Park Campground (RP Jerry Scute) which is less than a mile up Highway 168 from our location, contacted me and told me he had a bear broke his car window the night before.   I asked RP Scute what had happened, and he explained to me the following: RP Scute told me approximately 1 ½ weeks ago, a very large bear, black in color, had come into his camp.  The bear got to an empty ice chest.  The bear bit through the lid of the ice chest and then RP Scute scared the bear off.  RP Scute showed me the ice chest and it had holes consistent of bear teeth in the lid of the ice chest.  He had not seen the bear again until August 5, 2021, at approximately 12:30 am. He heard something outside his trailer but did not go out of his trailer to investigate.  In the morning he found the driver’s side window of his daughter’s car, a Toyota Yaris, CA Plate 6HWC421, had been broken out and the passenger’s side door window cracked.   I went to RP Scute’s camp site (Bishop Park Campground site #21) and found the Toyota Yaris with a broken driver’s door window and a cracked passenger’s door window.  I also found dirt / mud that had been wiped across the entire top of the window above the driver’s door frame, this is consistent of what a bear’s paw may leave.  RP Scute said he had talked to a camper, who was camping adjacent to RP Scute’s camp site.  This camper told RP Scute that he had a bear go by his camp earlier that morning at approximately 0500 HRS.  He did not have a good description of the bear.  This neighboring camper had already left by the time I arrived.   I asked RP Scute if he would like a depredation permit and he told me he did not want one.","Active","Inyo",37.2414995,"-118.598408"

Then he pulled a nearly fourty pound drawer that holds the garbage can in the base cabinets of the kitchen. He tore the drawer off of the guides and left it on its side in the center of the kitchen.

"WIR-2021-002557","8/2/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","On 08/03/21, at approximately 1418 Hours, I received a call from Fish and Wildlife Dispatch regarding an individual who had shot a bear in the Hermit Valley area of Alpine County.  Fish and Wildlife Dispatch advised me they had received the information from a US Forest Service office and that the original RP, a Daniel Gehringer, was standing by at a US Forest Service Facility where he had cell service.  I placed a call to Mr. Gehringer at approximately 1441 hours.  Mr. Gehringer related to me over the phone the following:   On the morning of 08/02/21 he was sleeping in his tent in the Hermit Valley area of Alpine County.  Gehringer was in the remote dispersed camp with his family, including numerous small children.  He was awoken sometime between 0500 and 0600 hours by a noise outside.  Gehringer opened his tent flap to see a large bear at the picnic table area of the camp.  Gehringer tried to frighten the bear away by yelling at it.  Instead of being frightened the bear approached Gehringer and put his head inside the tent.  Gehringer retreated into his tent and the bear then moved back to the picnic table area and proceeded to eat some of the food before leaving.  Gehringer stated the bear came back after a short time frame at which time he used a shovel to bang on a rock to make noise to frighten the bear.  Gehringer stated the bear left the camp at a slow pace, not acting as if it was scared.  Gehringer stated the bear returned to the campsite in the evening.  This time other members of his family assisted in using air horns, making loud noises and throwing rocks at the bear.  Gehringer stated they were able to push the bear about 400 yards outside of their camp.  After a short time the bear approached the camp again.  Gehringer and his family again used flashlights and horns to push the bear back out of their camp.  It was at this point Geheringer related that they made the decision to pack camp and leave.  Geheringer stated that some of the adults began moving the food from their vehicles, where it had been placed earlier in the day, in order to secure their children while the adults broke down camp.  Gehringer and another adult, later identified as Benjamin Hewitt, armed themselves with handguns being in fear that the bear would approach again while the adults were busy with the camp.  While gathering their camping equipment it was noticed that the bear had approached again within 20 feet of the camp perimeter.  The adults again tried to frighten the bear which this time did not move.  At this point Gehringer and Hewitt each fired on the bear with their handguns which then ran off.  Gehringer related to me they found the bear a short distance from camp, deceased.  Gehringer then stated the family decided to stay in camp and he left earlier in the day in an attempt to find someone to report the incident to.     I advised Gehringer to return to his camp and that I would respond as soon as I could.  I responded to the area with DFW Environmental Scientist Shelly Blair and arrived on scene at approximately 1730 hours.  On scene I observed a fairly large camp area with numerous adults and small children (from the age of approximately 8 to as young as an infant).  I also observed a rope line that had been extended partially around the camp perimeter from which hung soda cans.  I was later told that the cans contained pebbles and rocks to serve as a warning system, which had been erected the day prior.  I was met by Gehringer (who was later identified by his California Drivers License) as well as a Benjamin Hewitt (identified by Oregon DL) and a Christoper Hewitt (identified by California DL).  When interviewed all individuals related the same story as Gehringer.  The adults advised that they had not moved the fired casings from the handguns and showed them to me.  I observed 3 expended .45 caliber casings and 5 expended 9mm casings as close as approximately 6 feet from the camp perimeter.  Gehringer and B. Hewitt then showed me a blood stain on a nearby rock which is where they stated the bear had been standing when they shot at it.  This blood stain was approximately 20 feet from the camp perimeter.  I also observed a fairly heavy blood trail leading away from the camp.  Gehringer and B. Hewitt both related that since it was dark they would be less likely to protect their family from the bear and when it returned they were fearful the bear would harm themselves or one of their family members due to it’s brazen behavior and apparent fearlessness of humans.  Both individuals appeared remorseful that they felt forced to take the action they did against the bear.     I was then taken to the bear carcass which was approximately 100 yards from the camp.  Upon arriving at the carcass I immediately observed the bear had two ear tags, numbered 1274 and 1217.  A field necropsy was conducted with ES Blair.  We observed that it was a male bear in very poor body condition.  There appeared to be no fat reserves on the body and I could easily feel it’s ribs, thigh and hip bones.  Additionally it’s face appeared sunken in.  An inspection of it’s teeth revealed broken canines and molars that were severely rotten.  I also noted several penetrating wounds on the body.  Due to the size of the bear (though emaciated it still had a large frame), it’s remote location, and limited staff availability it was decided to leave it in the field.   I left the camp at approximately 1900 hours.  I spoke with two individuals who were camped approximately 100 yards away who related they had seen the bear the previous morning as well and described it as having no apparent fear of people.   ES Blair accessed department records for ear tagged bears and was able to identify the animal as the bear that was related from Placer County a year prior which had been accessing gas station and grocery stores to loot for food.","Closed","Alpine",38.5412747,"-119.8824695"

Dishion #490) received a phone call from RP Nick Scheara at Creekside RV Park on the south fork of Bishop Creek approximately 15 miles west of Bishop in Inyo County.  This area is prime bear habitat and are always present in the surrounding area.  I have spoken with the Scheara and his father Ron Scheara over the past ten years about bear issues in this area.  On this call, RP Nick Scheara told me that he had an “aggressive bear” at his campground.  I asked him what he meant by “aggressive” and he explained to me the bear gets into what he wanted to eat and did not seem to be in fear of people.  I asked RP Nick Scheara if the bear had gone after anyone or acted aggressively. He told me one guest said the bear stood up on its rear legs when the guess was trying to scare it off.    RP Nick Scheara said there had been three different bears walking around Creekside RV Park in the last week or two. The first bear he described as light color approximately 250 pounds.  This was the bear that has been coming into the camp the most and does not seem to be too concerned with the presence of people.  The second bear was described as a light-colored bear, same as the first one, but only weighs about 150-200 pounds. RP Nick Scheara told me there was a third bear, but he has not seen the bear himself.  He described it as a larger bear, black in color with a white front.    I have spoken with RP Nick Scheara in the past and advised him of proper food and trash storage.

He has continued to visit most nights at our cabin since and on Monday night overturned the garbage bins in a nearby campground. Most of the neighbors have reported activity and the next door cabin neighbor reported that a storage closet has been rifled several times now. Evidently the bear is well known due to his size which is impressive.

There are two subdivisions across the street from the Davis Rest Area in Lucerne, California.

This situation is alarming  as there are many kids and senior citizens in this area, and the destruction is occurring right at occupied homes.

Bears are omnipresent and this is one of many Interactions. Most of the time we just take in stride but this was too much. We keep our garbage can in the garage and the can is always cabled shut.   it was about 9 or so when I walked into my attached garage from the front. All lights were off. I noticed my empty garbage can in the walkway so I grabbed it to store it. At the same time, I noticed the second fridge door was ajar. The can was about 5 feet from the fridge. Then, a large bear stood up and growled. I stepped back instinctively as the can was the only thing between us it was that close. It took a swing at me but missed, I ran out the door with the bear on my tail and we went different directions. At that point my dog was chasing it with gusto. Over the next few hours, the bear would come back and lurk around the garage, which was of course closed, and the dog would chase if off again. She came home with puncture wounds on her haunches and front paw.   On Saturday July 17, he was back again. At 10 am my daughter was playing int the driveway and front yard when she also came danger close to the bear in my garage fridge. It took off with a large bag of dog food. At 3pm it was back again and stole a large cake and some cheese. I also found several scratches on my car doors, which were locked.   Last night, July 19, it was back again lurking about outside after dark. It was knocking over empty green waste cans in my driveway and attempting to gain access to my garage.   Look, we all love animals but this is too much. When we have to pack bear mace and a gun just to go outside at night thats when I start to raise my flag.","New","Nevada",39.2632244,"-121.0128858"

He has repeatedly tried to open my home doors and has been aggressive towards me when I try to scare him away. I have used air horn, pots and pans, mega phone, yelling, and shot my 22 hand gun into a tree at 2:00am 7/12 because he would not leave my porch. The noise from my gun did scare him away for about one hour but then he was back to circling my home and pacing my porch next to my sliding glass door. Last night was the worst night he had as most irritated and upset. He seems to get more angrier every-time I  chase him off. He refused to leave my porch lastnight and I felt my life was in danger as he stared me down and would not move so I called 911 while I was yelling at the bear to leave. It took 2 911calls before police  finally arrive. The officer was rude. Said he didn’t see a bear and I needed to call someone to handle the problem. I was not given a name or number of someone to call. I was given the number of wildlife volunteer Chris, also Phil Randle and Abby Gwinnett on a Facebook page the next morning . I am in the process of waiting to hear on how to handle this increasing dangerous situation. My 22 gun is now jammed.

The person was later identified as Shafik (contact phone number: (310) 871-9794). I spoke with Shafik and he explain the following. In summary, Shafik said he and approximately 100 other people were watching the fireworks on the 4th of July at Mt. Wilson in the Angeles National Forest. At approximately 2030 hours, a bear appeared from the bushes and approached a group of three men. The men were sitting approximately 15-20 feet from the bushes. The bear appeared to be looking for food/snacks. Shafik believed the bear was trying to grab a backpack when it allegedly bit at a man's hindquarters. After allegedly biting the man, the bear was scared back into the bushes by several subjects. The bear returned once more without incident. Shafik talked with the three men that were allegedly attacked. Shafik said the men claimed to be JPL engineers working on the Mars rover.

A 30 acre farm in OJAI.  He/She attempts to open the dumpster which is now chained. He eats oranges nightly.  The damage now is increasing- especially the last two weeks. He has destroyed several young ornamental Italian cypresses snapping them or stripping larger ones of branches. Recently he broke apart an espaliered plum tree and this week did severe damage to an apricot , palm, and a plum tree. He stripped them of all the fruit. It’s obvious he seeks the fruit and his weight is breaking the branches. I empathize with his hunger and thirst- he drains any garden bowls  of water.  BUT last night he approached our bedroom window. Our dog woke us and my flashlight saw him looking at us. When I banged on the window he turned and left.  I have slept with our door open in the summer heat for 30 years and the screen door locked. My wife is now over that!!!! She wants all the doors locked shut.  I respect the wildlife around us.

While driving through the East Fork Campground I observed a small bear through the campground in close proximity to small children near the creek. I estimated the bear to be approximately 20 yards from the children. I exited my truck and successfully redirected the Bear away from the children by shouting and walking aggressively towards the bear. The bear changed directions and proceeded to walk towards another campsite. The campers in that site began shouting at the bear and were using air horns in an attempt to scare the bear away. I returned to my vehicle to retrieve my shotgun pursued the Bear with my shotgun and bean bag munitions in an effort to haze the Bear away from the campground. While pursuing the bear, it ran up a trail and onto a road above the initial location. I heard a small child begin screaming frantically near where I last saw the bear. When I arrived at the location I heard the screaming, I saw a female adult holding a small crying child. She pointed up the hill and informed me the bear went in that direction. I continued to pursue the bear but was unable to regain sight of it after it entered a thick aspen grove uphill from the campground. I identified the animal as a small Black Bear approximately 100lbs with a blonde colored coat with darker colored face and arms. Upon subsequent interviews of various campers and hosts, I determined the bear I observed is frequenting the campsite. I collected photographs from various campers and showed them to the hosts at East Fork Campground, Rock Creek Campground and Rock Creek Resort.

Our young child was going outside when she came a little less than 40ft from the bear on our back wall behind some bushes. It was eating berries off some bushes. It then climbed our fence and went into the neighbors yard. The neighbors yard is full of lots and lots of trees.  We then put a camera outside just to see if  it had been returning in the evening. We have a small puppy that occasionally goes outside to go to the bathroom but we are now too scared to go out in the evening.  Yesterday (6/28/21) at 4:14am the bear returned walking right passed our french doors on our patio. We happen to have door handles that can accidentally be opened with just a little swipe.....we do keep the door locked at all times but you never know. It then proceeded to locate our garbages and made a mess with our trash. Later the same day around 9:15pm the neighbored contacted me saying the bear was back and heading down our street. By this time our trash cans were out on the street for the next days pick up and the bear did make his way into it again knocking over the can and emptying the trash on the lawn.  We have lived in this neighborhood for 7 years and this our first bear sighting in our yard. We are one of the only houses on the block without a pool so we aren't sure why the bear is coming into our yard with no food or water being left out.

"WIR-2021-001911","6/24/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","Narrative:  On 06/24/21, at approximately 2253 hours, I received a phone call from Norcom Dispatch reporting there had been a bear attack at 1601 Pioneer Trail, South Tahoe. Initial information reported an individual had been bitten by a bear, but medical attention had been denied by the victim. Additional information also revealed the bear had been shot with a firearm during the incident and El Dorado County Sheriff Deputies had responded to the residence. The initial call had been transferred to Norcom Dispatch from EDSO at approximately 2243 hours.  At 2258 hrs, I contacted the reporting party, Brandon Hawkins, by telephone. Hawkins, who indicated himself as a witness to the incident, confirmed the victim had not been injured and medical attention was not needed.  Hawkins stated they had entered the residence after returning from dinner when they heard a noise from inside the building. He stated the victim, later identified as Sylvester Warren III, recovered a personal firearm from the downstairs bedroom upon entering the residence after hearing the noise.  During this time it was described a bear charged the doorway area from the upstairs portion of the residence, where it made physical contact with Warren. The bear was described as very large and weighing approximately 500 pounds.  I spoke to Warren, who stated the bear had growled as it approached him and stood up on its hind legs. Warren stated the bear got on top of him after the initial charge. The bear placed its mouth on Warren’s arm during this portion of the incident, however, the bear did not bite down. Warren then fired a shot at the bears’ head with a 10mm Glock handgun. It appeared he may have hit the bear between its eyes. Warren stated the bear then moved in the direction of the bathroom and sliding glass door. Warren fired approximately 2-3 additional shots at the bears’ upper body area before it exited the residence through the downstairs sliding glass door.  During my initial phone call with reporting parties, I was advised EDSO deputies were currently searching for the bear outside the residence. I advised reporting parties of ways to preserve evidence; particularly the shirt worn by Warren. Following my initial contact with reporting parties, at 0010 hrs, I contacted EDSO dispatch where I was advised deputies had cleared the residence. I contacted Deputy Driscal at approximately 0013 hours, who advised he had collected Warren’s shirt, expended cartridges and what appeared to be bone fragment from the bears skull. Driscal additionally stated they had followed a blood trail that extended from behind the residence. Based on descriptions given, this appeared to be where the bear had exited after it had been shot by Warren. Driscal said they followed the blood trail for approximately one quarter mile, however, they were unable to locate the bear.  I spoke to Deputy Driscal again at approximately 0545 hours, who advised the items he had collected were located at the South Lake Tahoe EDSO office/station. Warden David Moskat later picked up the items that had been collected and placed in safe keeping.  On 06/25/21, at 0730 hrs, I arrived at 1601 Pioneer Trail and I met USDA trapper John Chandler. Together we walked behind the building where we located a stairway that extended from the ground to a deck and sliding glass door. The sliding glass door provided access to the downstairs portion of the residence and appeared consistent with the sliding glass door previously referenced by reporting parties. There was obvious blood splatter extending down the stairs to the ground.  Chandler and I followed the blood stains and tracks northwest of the residence to a wooded area located between Boren Way, Nottaway Dr. and Acoma Circle. During the tracking process the blood stains that initiated at 1601 Pioneer Trail remained consistent in appearance and ended at a large bear lying on the ground within downed timber. The bear appeared to be between 400-500 pounds. The bear was not “bedded” in a normal or resting position.  The body position indicated it was dead or severely injured. Chandler and I walked within approximately 15 feet of the bear, where we could see it was breathing, with blood coming from the mouth.  Considering its condition, a closer evaluation of the bears’ wounds appeared nonsurvivable , so I decided to euthanize it with a firearm. I euthanized the bear at approximately 0910 hours. The location was found to be: N38 52’55.14 W119 59’28.26 Chandler and I removed the bear.   I returned to the residence at 1601 Pioneer Trail, where I re-interviewed all witnesses and victim and viewed the physical characteristics of the building. During the inspection, I found bloodstains in the downstairs area next to the bathroom and sliding glass door to be consistent with statements made by the victim concerning the direction the bear moved during the incident. Blood stains from inside the residence were swabbed and labeled as Item #1.  Blood stains from the decking outside the downstairs sliding glass door were swabbed and labeled as item #2.  Based on statements and observations made, it appeared the bear was able to open sliding glass doors and entered the building through the downstairs area. The outside of the downstairs sliding glass door was swabbed and labeled as item #3.  I found the upstairs area, consisted of food items that likely attracted the bear. It appears the bear had moved upstairs where it found food in the kitchen. While upstairs, the bear also tore through a screen door from inside and entered a balcony upon the second floor.  The entryway to the residence also serves as a narrow stairway between the upstairs and downstairs areas. According to witnesses, the bear charged the entryway from the second-floor balcony. Although the bear may have been attempting to exit the residence, it reportedly made huffing and growling noises as it charged the entry area. The bear also allegedly made swiping motions with its front claws as it approached the victim within the stairway.  Based on statements, the bear came within very close proximity of the victim in the narrow stairway, forcing the victim backwards and onto his back. During this time, the bear reportedly made physical contact with the victim.  Based on the totality of information, it appears reasonable that Warren feared for his safety while in close contact with the bear. Based on statements, it also appeared Warren was in a position where he was unable to move away from the advancing bear.  Following my interviews at 1601 Pioneer Trail, I met with Warden David Moskat. I removed a section of ear from the recovered bear. I placed the section of ear in a sealed evidence bag and labeled it as item #4.  All samples collected in connection to this investigation were taken by Warden Moskat to the Wildlife Forensic Lab on 06/25/21 for comparative DNA analysis.  At approximately 1300 hrs, I transported the bear to the regional office.  The carcass was given to Vet. B. Monk.","New","El Dorado",38.8844449,"-119.9858322"

I called the RP Jean Boggs on the phone who lives next to the victim on Cambrai Court in Burney.  Boggs stated that her neighbor Allen Kernan was attacked by a black bear at his residence -20018 Cambria Court, Burney CA. 96013.  Boggs stated that Kernan is an employee at the Burney Hospital Annex in Burney (Mayers Memorial Hospital) and was going to have his injuries evaluated and treated there.  At approximately 0500 hours, I met Allen at the Burney Hospital Annex.  I contacted Kernan and introduced myself to him as a State Fish and Wildlife Officer.  I explained to Kernan that I was following up on a report that I received of a bear attack that occurred that morning.  Kernan stated that at approximately 0430 hours, he walked out of his front door to head to work, once he turned the corner near his garage he was met with a large black bear.  The bear was blond in color and approximately 3.5 feet tall standing on all four legs.  Kernan stated that the bear swiped at him a couple of times.  One of the swipes made contact on his right arm and his lower right torso.  Blood was drawn on his arm and his injuries consisted of three lacerations of approximately 3 inches long and 2 centimeters wide. The swipe on his torso did not break skin but tore through his medical scrub shirt. Kernan stated that he ran to his truck to get away from the bear. Kernan reported the incident to his neighbor Jean Boggs, who then called 911.  I photographed injuries of Kernan and collected his medical scrub shirt that the bear had swiped at.  I then followed Kernan to his residence to gather further evidence. At approximately 0530 hours, I arrived at Kernan’s address (20018 Cambrai Court) and photographed evidence of where the incident took place.  I also collected hair samples of where the bear had climbed over a fence.  Kernan stated that he had seen a bear bathing in his pond a few days prior to the incident.  Kernan also stated that his next-door neighbor has security photos of the bear that was taken on 6/27/2021.  There were also three bins of trash cans outside of Kernan’s garage that appeared to be undisturbed. Kernan stated that he was extremely distraught and was going to take the rest of the day off from work.

So then the bear tore apart my kitchen, left feces in my dish strainer and broke a window trying to get back out.

"WIR-2021-001491","5/30/2021 0:00","Black Bear","General Nuisance","On the morning of Sunday, May 30,  at 6:00 am, a cinnamon colored black bear tore into my garbage can and scattered trash around. It was sitting about 10 yards away from me and I tried banging pots, throwing rocks, and yelling at it to go away. It started in my direction and I retreated. He finally went away to my neighbors and someone shot in the air to scare  it away and it moved back over by my place and sat down. It would not leave. After about 1/2 hour, it got up and moved on. I picked up my trash and moved the trash indoors. The bear returned the next morning around 5:30 and moved my bear proof ice chest, but could not get into it. It then moved on to my neighbors place and I never saw it after that. The bear has been around for awhile as my twin brother took a picture of it by Camp McCumber about a month ago and we have captured it on digital game cameras on the property.  The incident occurred in the McCumber Lake area of Shasta County off of Wild Goose Way off of Thatcher Mill Rd., in the McCumber Lake area. I have a small hunting/fishing cabin there and frequently go up on weekends. My 8 year old granddaughter frequently visits there and I am concerned that the bear might harm her as it seems to NOT be afraid of humans.","New","Shasta",40.5456185,"-121.7281404"
"WIR-2021-001489","5/30/2021 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","On Sunday, May 30, 2021, I was hiking at La Tuna Canyon from approximately 4:30 - 7:30 PM. I was coming down the fire road around 7:20 where I heard a loud commotion. Where I was at this point is wilderness space at where the road turns at a 90 degree angle. I saw a very large brown bear climbing up a steep hillside where rocks and dirt where falling. The bear was stretched out so it looked HUGE!!! The wilderness space can be described as very shady and dark with rocks, a steep hillside, a great place for wildlife to shelter and hide. During heavy rains, water can build up and create a pond like place where water can sit. There is also a culvert under the fire road there. On the other side is large trees that offer shade all day and a canyon where animals go as well. When I saw the bear, I panicked. I started running on the fire road to get away. I know that was the wrong thing to do but I was by myself and was scared. As I was coming down the road, I previously saw other people in front of me down below on the the road so when I saw the bear, I was running to get to those people. Earlier, I had passed a family with husband, wife and two young boys (maybe 5-6 and 9-10) and two dogs (one small and one larger). I was worried about them because they were coming down the same route as me and I did not know if they would encounter the bear. The family was making a lot of noise with talking, etc. It turns out they did not see the bear.  I hike this route everyday and hundreds and hundreds of people / bicyclists are on this trail everyday too. I hope that you will go out to explore this area and find this bear. I do not know if it has cubs. The location of this bear siting will put people in harms way.  Please contact me if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you and have a great day.","Active","Los Angeles",34.2284958,"-118.3075981"

Last week, this bear broke into my Jeep.  I reported that incident online.  I also reported the bear break-in 6 houses away at 8857 Meeks Bay Ave, Tahoma, CA, that occurred on 5/23/2021..    Unfortunately, we had another bear incident last night. The same bear that is bothering the neighborhood opened the door to my son’s Jeep vehicle parked in front of 8357 Meeks Bay Ave. at 3:58 AM this morning(5/31/21).  The bear climbed in the Jeep but found no food and exited the vehicle leaving the driver’s door open.  We found the door open in the morning.  My adult son's name is:       William A.S. Magrath III    (Telephone:  775-233-7903      2626 Union Street,       San Francisco, CA 94123  We know the time of this incident from the security camera we have at our home’s front door. I have forwarded a copy of the voide to CDFW ideo which shows the events when the bear broke into the car.   In the video, you will first see darkness with four lights in the lower left corner of the screen. Those lights are a reflection off the dual pane window behind which the security camera sits. The car is about 40 feet from the camera.    Soon, at 3:58 AM, you will see another light illuminate inside the Jeep which is the interior light (above the driver and passenger side seats). The bear (or some motion) can be seen inside the Jerp and then exited the vehicle towards the rear (left side of the screen). The bear then walks in front of a “motion detector” light we have at the top of our stairs which illuminates and you can see the rear of the big bear as it walks past the camera towards the south.  These continuing intrusions into houses and vehicles make all of my neighbors wonder what actions the CDFW will take with respect to this problem bear. None of us want this bear coming through our front doors like occurred at the Kinions’ house. We would prefer that the problem bear be moved to another location far away from residences - so he/she can live out a normal life without the attraction of human food.  As more people visit this area in the coming months, there will be more conflicts and problem for this bear. So, now is the time to intervene to remove the problem bear before it gets worse.  I look forward to hearing from you.    Thanks to the CDFW team.    Bill Magrath. (775-750 3030)","Active","El Dorado",39.0307482,"-120.1173393"

The location was 47 Hawk Ridge Drive, Clio; no other details were provided at the time.  Upon my arrival, I pulled up to the corner of Hawk Ridge and White Hawk Drive, the residence was approximately 100 yards from that location.  Deputy Bjorn Berg, with the Plumas County Sheriff Department was already on scene.   At the time, I observed a brown shepherd mix dog laying adjacent to Deputy Berg.  The dog was still breathing and trying to raise its head, the dogs back appeared to be shredded from the neck to the rump, skin was missing exposing the ribs, spine and what remained of the dog’s loin.  The dog’s front legs were torn exposing portions of the skeleton and muscle of the upper arm and forearm.  There was a large pool of blood was directly under the dog and it was clear that the bear had been eating the dog. (video and photos were taken). I then observed a large black bear, cinnamon brown in color with a white diamond on its chest.  The bear looked to be between four to five hundred pounds and was hissing, huffing, and snapping its teeth.  I was standing about ten yards away from the bear which had climbed up a nearby Ponderosa Pine tree and perched itself on the bottom limb. Deputy Berg told me that upon his arrival the bear was standing on top of the dog tearing large chunks of flesh from the dogs back, then eating it.  The dog was yelping out loudly in pain.  Deputy Berg tried yelling and using his siren and horn to scare the bear off, but the bear continued eating the dog.  Deputy Berg said that the bear had charged at him, but then retreated.  Trying to save the dog’s life, Deputy Berg then retrieved his shotgun and approached the bear; that is when the bear retreated up the Ponderosa Pine tree.    During our conversation, I observed the bear trying to come down from the tree.  Deputy Berg and I were approximately 30 yards away from our patrol vehicles from any form of protection. Concerned the bear was trying to protect its kill I was concerned the bear may be acting predatorial.  Due to Deputy Berg’s statement, my personal observation, my experience, my training, and the concern for the safety of myself and Deputy Berg, I made the decision to dispatch the bear.  Using my department issued patrol rifle, I fired one round, successfully dispatching the bear. Following the shot, the dog’s owner, Roger Tew began walking towards our direction.  He yelled out, “Is my dog still alive?”  I told Mr. Tew that his dog was still alive but was in bad shape.  I stated that I did not believe his dog would be able to recover and was suffering.  Mr. Tew observed the state of his dog and became emotionally upset.  Mr. Tew asked, “Did you get that son of a bitch.” I nodded my head and pointed to the direction where the bear was lying.   Mr. Tew requested if I could put his dog down for him to end its suffering.  Deputy Berg was standing next to me when Mr. Tew gave me consent.      Mr. Tew then relayed the incident to me as such: At around 2130 hours, his wife Jan Tew, was letting the dog out to use the bathroom.  At the time, they were standing at their back door which has a deck that drops down into the back yard.  Not more than twenty seconds later, Jan and Roger heard their dog screaming and yelping.  Mr. Tew opened the back door and saw the black bear standing about four feet away.  Mr. Tew thought the dog was already dead because he saw no movement, he then grabbed a mop and began to hit the bear over and over, but the bear continued to shake the dog.  Mr. Tew said he could hear his dog’s bones breaking as the bear’s teeth clamped down and shook the dog rigorously.   He then watched the bear drag the dog off into the darkness across the street and that is when Mr. Tew stated he went inside and called 911 for help.  Mr. Tew does not have any dog food or garbage near the back door or adjacent to the property.  The garbage is secured as well as the dog food. There is nothing near the back door or the house that would attract bears or predatorial animals.  Photographs, video, and documentation were taken of the dog and bear as evidence.   Deputy Berg and I then removed the dog from the location and returned it to Mr. Tew.","New","Plumas",39.7182337,"-120.5369099"

There was no food inside and fortunately, no damage was done. The bear left the door open and walked away.  I found the open car 15 minutes later and observed on my video security cameras when the bear opened my car door and entered the car.  The video shows a large (300#) bear walk by the camera view 20 seconds later. I have the video for you if you want it.    This morning at 8:15 AM, I saw a 300 pound bear about 40 yards south of my house walking in the middle of Meeks Bay Avenue.  I took a photo of the bear which turned downhill between homes toward the Lake when a car approached.  I will be happy to send you this photo.    Sunday morning, I was called by a neighbor and told of a possible bear breakin six houses south of my home at 8387 Meeks Bay Ave, a cabin owned by Todd and Patrice Kinion.  I walked down there that morning and saw the front door was open.  As I approached, a coyote raced out the front door and turned south.  But the yard was filled with bear scat and food stuff debris from the food removed from the cabin's kitchen.  I turned on my video camera and slowly walked toward the door making noise in case a bear was still inside.  When I was sure the house was clear of bears, I videoed as I walked inside. Bear scat and foodstuffs were on the living room floor.  In the kitchen, the cabinets were all open and the freezer and main parts of the refrigerator were emptied onto the floor.  More bear scat was on the kitchen floor.  This bear was in this house for awhile.  I found the Kinion's phone number on the wall and called them and told them of the bear entry.  Their phone number is (831) 722-5744 or (831) 840-7829.  I suggested the Kinions notify CDFW of this bear entry,.  This bear did a lot of damage.  I locked up the house at the Kinion's direction and sent them the video.  I will send CDFW the video if you request.    My next door neighbor, Paul Marshall, at 8361 Meeks Bay Ave, had a bear break in last year through a basement door.  They reinforced that door with heavier hinges and double hasps (top and bottom on the side).  In the last week, a bear has tried to open that same door again and has torn off some of the new plywood door - but was not able to get inside the house.  Seeing the bear today at 8:15 am and knowing a bear is breaking into vehicles and neighboring homes convinces me that our local neighborhood has a problem bear.  This bear is aggressive and habituated.  It is not able to open the bear proof garbage cans we all have so it is now breaking into homes and vehicles.  I have a grandson I am concerned about.  I am worried when my wife takes the garbage out at night to the bear proof can.  This bear is dangerous.  I urge the CDFW to immediately investigate this area and perhaps humanely trap this bear before someone is injured by this bear.    I know the bears were here before the houses.  But these bears are finding food in contractor's dumpsters (thrown away lunches, etc.) and are now breaking into houses.  This is a dangerous situation.  I fear some neighbor may try to shoot a bear and the bullet ends up in some unintended place.  I urge the CDFW to fix this problem before a disaster.  That is why I am writing to you.    I will be happy to provide any additional information, video tapes of bear damages, or the photo of the 300# bear I saw 30 yards away at 8:15 am this morning.  Call me at (775) 750-3030.    Thanks to all the good folks at CDFW.  You do amazing work.  I just wish I did not have a problem bear in my neighborhood.    Thank you.  Bill Magrath","New","El Dorado",39.0308365,"-120.1171891"

I am located in Burney and I've have a bear cub on my property getting into my garbage, which happens, but this little guy concerns me because he isn't afraid of me or my dogs. Today I spent ten minutes hollering at him, stomping, etc, I even sprayed the water hose at him. My 3 big dogs were in the yard barking and my Rottweiler even approached him, but he just continued eating. His lack of fear concerns me a lot, as he's going to get bigger and braver. I don't want him getting hurt and I don't want anyones kids or pets getting hurt, so I am hoping he can be relocated. This is the first time I've seen this bear on my property, but I've heard of a bear on neighbors property recently, so I am assuming it is the same one. He appears to be a yearling, but he could be older. I haven't seen any adult bears here this season.

I was told that the bear was not scaring away easily and was coming into the camp areas for food. I received a report of another sighting of the same bear on April 19th. On April 24th, shortly after midnight, I was informed that the bear was back again, and would not leave even after shining lights on it and beeping car horns. On April 24th at approximately 1830 hours, I patrolled Big Pine Canyon with Warden Peabody in an attempt to locate the bear. We spotted the bear in the Glacier Lodge campground area, and it showed no fear of me or Warden Peabody. I was able to walk to within approximately 30 yards of the bear and deployed a less than lethal bean bag round on the bear’s hind quarter. The bear slowly trotted off while I attempted to catch up to it in order to deploy another bean bag on the bear. The bear remained nearby but behind cover, and at one point attempted to make its way back to the campground by walking around us. Eventually, Warden Peabody and I left the area after giving advisements to campers in the area. On the morning of April 25th I was informed by one of the Sage Flat Campground hosts (located below Glacier Lodge) that the bear had returned and had broken into a few coolers. I made contact with the campers who showed me a picture of the same bear I had seen the previous night. The bear broke into multiple coolers that were stored near the campers’ tent. I informed the campers that the bear would return and that they were to clean up the mess and secure all food and scented items in bear safe containers. When back in an area with cell service, I informed USFS LEO who responded to the area to speak with the campers. USFS LEO agreed to patrol Big Pine Canyon and inform campers about the bear problem.

When the RP walked to the doorway that lead to the laundry room, they saw an adult bear standing in the entry way. The bear panicked and tried to get out by climbing on the widows and on top of the washing machine. The RP closed the door that connects the kitchen and laundry room and called 911. After speaking with a dispatcher, the RP did not hear any noise and looked in the room. The bear was gone.   I (Lt. Renner) called the RP on 5/15/21 and made a site visit to inspect the property damage. I noted that the door had a pet opening and it was damaged. I also noted and photographed damage to the door jam. It appeared that the bear made entry by leaning its weight on the door causing the door trim to break and the door being free to open. I observed muddy bear prints on 2 windows (inside and outside), muddy prints the floor inside the laundry room and the doorway to the kitchen as well as on top of the washing machine. There was no other damage inside the room. The RP stated that the bear appeared to be scared and looking for a quick way out. Looking around the immediate area, I did not notice any loose trash or exposed pet food or other attractants.

I see him or her once or twice a day on the cameras I have set up around my house. For the last I'd say three weeks or so, it's been a daily occurrence.  I'm not necessarily threatened by bears in general — bears are adorable, and we live in bear country, after all! — but the proximity does give me some pause, since it's five or ten feet away from my drive and front door.  I don't know if this is something we should just keep tabs on (and our dogs under closer watch!) until the bear decides to move on, or if it's worth investigating it further, so I thought I'd at least report it. Mostly I'm just worried about the location- the culvert kind of makes it trickier to anticipate for everyone since it's not obvious you're near where a bear lives, and that's not an ideal situation, for human or for bear.

Bears are frequently seen in our neighborhood, adjacent to state forest land - but they're usually wary enough no to approach the front door.   The bear we observed was on our front porch around 10:30PM.  We heard a crash and upon investigation encountered the bear outside the front door. The crash was a wooden baby gate that blocked a small staircase up to the deck, which the bear had climbed over and broke.  The bear grunted and huffed and soon exited off the back of the deck, climbing over another baby gate and the deck railing.  It left puddles of slobber and some claw marks.    We routinely get bears, and occasionally they tip over garbage cans (which are over 100 feet from our house). Two years ago, a bear tore through our wood plank fence and removed the side of our duck house, absconding with one duck.  But we have not felt the need to report a nuisance animal as we are adjacent to JDSF land and expect to live with bears and other wildlife. We've never had a bear on the deck, however.  Today I learned that a neighbor also saw evidence of the bear (paw print, claw marks and destroyed bird feeders).   Just wanted to report this behavior for CDFW's information.  We're going to add an additional sensor light and remove any attractants and hope the bear will give up on coming so close to the house.","Active","Mendocino",39.4003369,"-123.7775797"

Upon arrival, she saw that a shutter over a window had been pulled open and the window screen pulled down with claw marks on the screen. The dogs started barking and as she went to the front deck, she saw a large brown colored black bear leaving the deck.January 24, 2020: My wife and I went to go repair the shutters. We found that an access door under the deck leading to the 3ft tall crawl space under the cabin was broken open. There were tree limbs scattered around the area and especially at the entrance to the crawl space (photos available). There were also scratch marks on the trees as if a bear-sized animal had climbed the trees to break off limbs for a den. The scattered branches had marks as if they were broken off, not chewed off as beavers may do (there is a beaver in the area cutting down large trees). We would be glad to provide photos of the den material (4-6 feet long by 2-3 feet wide branches).We made plenty of noise on the deck directly above the opening while repairing the shutters. No bear siting occurred. We left the opening and branches undisturbed. The area is not in a public area and is not on a throughfare.Question:  We were wondering if it would be wise to just let the bear den under the cabin until spring? It would be interesting to use a game camera to get photos. What are the options? The family members who own it are animal-friendly and would be fine letting it den there over the winter, unless there are overriding circumstances that would prohibit or advise against it.

The bear seemed to be a little bit interested in the car/garage door, but it wasn't actively attempting to do anything. (The neighbor subsequently mentioned capturing a bear by his car twice before on video.) In response to seeing the bear, I got out of the hot tub and clapped loudly and yelled at it from our deck. It just sort of took me in and didn't really respond with any movement for at least 30 seconds of clapping and yelling. I quit the clapping and yelling for about 1 minute until I found a big plastic snow shovel and started whacking it on the deck railing. This was fairly noisy and the bear seemed to start moving into the street toward me but maybe also toward the direction of the forest a couple blocks uphill from my location. At this moment, some dogs up the street--toward where the bear might have been thinking of heading--started barking and I might have heard a neighbor come out/speak up (not sure). At this point, the bear reversed direction and made a clear move to exit the opposite way (off the street and into a wooded area separating our homes from the backs of homes on the street below us (downhill) which is Springs Ct. It trotted briefly to until is was 20 yards from the driveway and into the wooded area, then kept slowly moving in that direction until it was out of my sight.I checked the ""...feels threatened"" box only because 1) the bear seemed pretty unresponsive to my presence and initial clapping and yelling, and 2) we are temporary renters for the winter and are not accustomed to dealing with bears, and 3) as temporary renters we can't install electronic fencing to protect our home from attempted entry.","Closed","Placer",39.0621588,"-120.1448569"

They sent game wardens who I was told told attempted to scare him away.  The removed the skirting at various points to give the bear an exit point. I returned to my home on Christmas day and the bear was still there and I discovered that my furnace was not heating the house. I spent a sleepless night due to the cold and noise from the bear.The next day Friday I called the Patrol Office and was told they were not bear removal experts and referred me to the wildlife office. The patrolman did suggest I put industrial strength ammonia at one end of the crawlspace with a fan to see if that will make him leave. I too am not a bear removal specialist. I am 72 of age, I survived a quadruple heart bypass operation and I suffer from a form of COPD.I did think the bear was gone and I inspected underneath my home and found that he has destroyed my heating ducts and has removed the insulattion at various points undermeath my home in an attempt I believe to break in. Lucky for me I did not get hurt as the bear was wtill down there I just did not see him.I contacted the wildlife office who also told me that they were limited in what they can do because of limitations placed on them by PMC rules. Yesterday the bear damaged my water pipes and I had to shut the water off. I have no idea as to the extent of the damage.I called the patrol office was was asked if I followed thier ammonia suggestion. Which I told him I do not have the physical ability to do that.

He had received a report from his field staff about a severely burnt bear in between Mammoth pools and Kinsman flat area in one of the more severely burnt portions of the Creek fire. He related to me GPS coordinates of the last known location 37,27018, -119.35388, and a short video of the bear taken by field staff. The video showed a mature bear which was severely emaciated, walking on its front elbows and taking tossed hand outs from people. The following afternoon on 11/25/2020, I headed up to the area to look for the bear and assess its condition. On the way up, I spoke with the local wildlife unit biologist and discussed the background on the situation. He had been up to look for the animal the day before and had been unsuccessful, but he related that he had discussed the situation with supervisory staff and the lab. I arrived on site around 1330 hours and located a bear sitting under a small cluster of burnt trees/shrubs near the coordinates I had been given. I could get to within about 10 feet of the bear with little reaction. Upon visual inspection, the bear was extremely skinny with ribs, hips and joints being visible through its fur. Its coat was not heavily singed as it looked to have survived the initial blaze from the fire. The Primary burns when on its feet/ paws which occur when the animal tries to forage or traverse the hot, chard ground that's left after the fire. The bears paws were severely burnt. All the pads where burnt off with several spots where burns had broken through in the the underlying tissues. All of its toes were burnt off, with one front paw retaining remnants of the nail beads. It was walking on its front elbows and they were burnt through the skin and into the muscles and joints underneath.I considered capturing the bear but its burns were very severe, so much so that I doubt it could have ever returned to a normal life as a bear, it was also so weak that capture might have killed it from stress, prolonging the agony it had to be in. I felt the best course of action was to euthanize the animal and end it suffering. The animal was collected and transported to the Fresno office for cold storage and future necropsy. It weighed approximately 85 lbs and I could put my thumb and index finger around its femur it was so emaciated. This animal with with fat storage should have weighted around 200 lbs.","Active","Madera",37.2701976,"-119.3539872"

He was really fast because by the time I got outside it was already gone. The following night (Sunday 1/1/20)  the bear got into our garbage can and I actually caught it in the act and took a video of it. I tried to scare it away but it couldn't be bothered, it just looked up at me and kept going through the garbage. After a few minutes of yelling it finally left.

We live out in the 'country' in Ono, California and have always had trash pick up around 10-11 with Waste Management (near Redding, California). We have always battled with our neighbors to put trash out in the mornings to avoid the inevitable bear going through the trash and, except for a single neighbor whose trash consistently gets 'beared' we have been successful in getting people to put their trash out in the morning rather than the night before. We also had an incident several years ago where a bear became such a nuisance that a permit was given to cull the animal. We DO have bears out here and understand we need to live with them. Unfortunately, Waste Management recently (past 3 weeks) changed our pickup from 10-11, to 6:30 am. This is going to force people to put their trash out the night before and will definitely cause more bear interactions and, perhaps lead to a nuisance cull or someone getting hurt. We have called Waste Management and explained the situation to no avail and were hoping that if Wildlife were to step in and explain the situation, that they might be more willing to change our pickup time back to a later time, reserving the earlier times for people in the city who can leave their trash out overnight.

It was about 3ft tall and very round looking. Like a giant fur covered beach ball. The kitchen door has a lever handle and the bear must have pushed on the handle back and forth for several seconds while loudly sniffing and pressing on the door, at this point the bear was on the other side of a solid door and I could not see it. I yelled and made a lot of loud noise. The sniffing and pressing stopped, and I assume it left. I had locked the door a few hours earlier on a whim. I imagine the bear would have entered if the door had opened when it jiggled the handle. This seemed like the same bear I saw a month ago, but I can't be sure.

It came through the garage 2x , pulling trash outside and across the street. We called the local Sheriff who responded to our location and gave the bear a warning shot with a bean bag gun. Shortly after, the bear retreated and we were able to collect the garbage. The first time we witnessed this bear breaking into our garage about a month ago, 2-3 other garages were also damaged that same evening.","New","El Dorado",38.8974826,"-120.0362281"

This would be the first time I am concerned with the safety of my family and community. My own personal encounters with this bear started when he decided to lick my barbeque for a bit. Just ripped the cover off and was licking grease. We started putting containers of pine sol out to deter this activity with success but we have had more recent encounters in the evenings. He went into a bag of toys going to a thrift store and a Halloween costume bag on the side of the house. Normally loud shouts scare him off but recently he goes 10 ft and turns to look at me. On Monday we awoke to our car horn. We are very good at not having food gum in the car. He was in the car and I approached to open the door and he started attacking/biting the window and door I was going to open. I backed off as this was more of an aggressive action not typical with previous encounters with bears. My wife grabbed our keys allow us to roll down the windows with our remote and the bear was able to exit. In addition to our vehicle damage that is down in the shop in Reno. Our next door neighbor's mom's car was broken into on Sunday. Our schoolhouse was broken into last week. Another neighbor's basement has been broken into and last night another car was broken into. There has been an increase in activity but my concern is that this bear is no longer fearful of humans.

I live in the Angeles National Forest off Big Tujunga Canyon Road. About 1/2 mile down from my house and before the Angeles National Forest sign (but definitely still under Forest Services umbrella of land) a lot of people use the riverbed for swimming and grilling although it is not maintained or looked after. They have been leaving A LOT of trash over the last year and we've been waiting for a bear to show up. On September 1st a friend of mine took video of a bear getting into the trash with many people and cars around. Since then we have seen people coming to ""look"" for the bear and leaving food intentionally. (picture #1)The first time we saw it was on September 12th, a young bear came to our glass front door and pressed his nose to the glass and just kind of peaked in at us. Our dogs rushed the door and it just kind of meandered off. We followed from a distance and observed it go directly to our neighbors front door next. (video #2 of it wandering away from our door)On September 16th, we saw it come around again. I had been walking up from our chicken coop saw it coming up from the riverbed. Came right to the front door again (got barked at). (video #3 at front door)On September 22nd, we were sitting inside our chicken run and it just walked right up (observed) and then went on it's way. (video #4 walking away from coop and up to house)Wednesdays are our trash days and we have to leave our cans up on the street. It has been visiting Wednesday mornings now as well. We have been waking up early, so that it doesn't set out the night before and the bear was already in our front yard this morning the 23rd and gave us a little surprise. My brother yelled at it and it just kind of observed again.It travels up and down the riverbed I believe. It doesn't bother me that it's around really, but it doesn't seem to be afraid of people at all. I worry a lot about the people who use the riverbed and have been leaving food. They are the kind of folks that ignore 10 signs saying the forest is closed and take bbq grills down into dense areas while there's a wildfire currently going on just miles away.I will attach a video of the area where the riverbed is being used and the bear has been hanging out. We contacted forest services maybe about 10 times (voicemails, emails, in person, and notes on windshields). For awhile they said it wasn't their land, but the ranger we spoke with in person was there cleaning up that area and said it was part of Angeles National Forest. Since then they have cleaned up a lot of the trash, but right now the forest is closed with a Sheriff blocking the road.","Active","Los Angeles",34.2984548,"-118.2793598"

It was originally reported that the bear had attacked the female property owner and her dogs. It was later determined that the bear never made contact with the RP or her dogs, but rather the bear was acting unusually aggressive. The address where the incident occurred is 41930 North Fork Drive in Three Rivers.Rebecca Riddle (RP) states that on the evening of 09/20/20, she let her two dogs out into the yard and they encountered a bear in the yard. The bear seemed overly aggressive and did not run off like bears normally do. On the morning of 09/21/20, the RP again let her two dogs into the yard thinking the bear from the previous night would be gone. Her dogs again encountered the bear and the bear again seemed very aggressive. She said her dogs were barking at the bear and attempting to chase it off, but the bear would not leave. The RP said she began yelling at the bear, but the bear remained aggressive and would not run away. She went back into the house and got her husband, who also attempted to scare the bear away. Worried about the safety of his pets, the RP's husband ran towards the bear and the bear went up into a tree in their yard. Wildlife Officer Lutz, Lieutenant Sheeley, Wildlife Biologist King and I all responded to the incident. Lutz was the first to arrive at 41930 North Fork Drive and observed a large sow and cub in a tree in the front yard of the residence. I arrived a short time later, and observed that the sow was showing signs of being protective of her cub. This explained the aggressive behavior being exhibited by the sow. I also observed signs that the bear(s) had gotten into trash cans in the area. A neighbor stated the RP often puts out piles of cat food for the feral cats in the area. I also observed fruit trees on the property. Lutz used a Department issued Pepper Ball gun to fire pepper balls into the tree where the sow and cub were. After approximately 15 minutes, the sow came down from the tree and the cub followed a short time later. Once the sow came down, I observed it was wearing a tracking collar, indicating it had most likely been a problem bear in the nearby Sequoia National Park and had been previously captured by NPS. Both the sow and cub started making their way towards the Kaweah River. Wildlife Biologist King and I pursued the bears towards the river while yelling. I also fired a single round from my Department issued shotgun into some trees to create noise to further scare the bears away. Prior to clearing the scene, Lutz and King spoke with the RP about the attractants she has on her property (feeding pets outside, fruit trees, and unsecured trash cans).","New","Tulare",36.4423614,"-118.9055057"

The first time, the mama bear and the two cubs first went to the garbage bins and emptied it. Then, they came to the patio door (thank god it was locked and closed) and they were all looking inside at us and sniffing the door. I frantically knock on the patio door to scare them away but it didnt phase them at all. The mama bear even made an attempt at standing on two feet (went almost half way). Then, I realized that I was way too close to the bear and she probably could smash the patio door, if so desired. So, I backed up and she retreated and proceeded to calmly walk off the property and climbing the fence back into the field behind our house. The bear had a tag and I believe it was #51. We live at La Vina community and heard a bear and two cubs has been in the area for 3+ months now. We heard a bear had also raided a home earlier this summer - not sure if it is the same one. When they came back the second time that afternoon, I went outside with a baseball bat and tried to make myself look big and when they walked away from the fence, I tapped on the fence with the bat. The mama bear was looking at me but was not scared. In short, this bear and her two cubs did not seem scared of us at all.

Damage was done to the chicken coup, as the bear had torn open a side door, then got trapped in the coup for about an hour (based on video) and once I go out to chase him, he broke the fencing and escaped, jumping over electric fencing.At last count, based on all neighbors' posts on Nextdoor.com and my own observations, we are dealing with a mom and 2 cubs, an aggressive juvenile (with the gray patch on its back), and a 4th large bear.","Closed","Los Angeles",34.2414511,"-118.2275333"

The following is a summary of the events from the RP. Thank you for your email. I was sleeping in my tent at campsite 12 in Chilkoot campgrounds when I felt a sharp pain at around 2AM. I sat up, thinking something had bit me, and saw the silhouette of the bear outside my tent. I screamed to try to scare it, and it ran away back into the woods. I had no food in my tent or my campsite, but some other campers further from the woods had a huge amount of food left out on and around their picnic table. The only reason I can imagine the bear did this is because it was attracted by the smell of their food and then saw me sleeping and got curious. I definitely didn’t sense any aggression from the bear at all.  I have two scratch marks on my butt and dark bruising but there wasn’t any blood, so I didn’t go to a doctor. I did want to report it to you all so I appreciate you reaching out. I also told the campsite host, but he declined to warn other campers or ask them to properly store their food. Please let me know if any other information would be helpful. Thank you,Sofia Wildlife Officer Andrew Walker went to Chilkoot CG to investigate. Met with Camp Host Jerry Jarocki who wrote a incident summary but did not report it to authorities. Jerry told WO Walker that he has not educated campers about securing food and garbage. WO Walker advised Jerry about educating the campers and gave Jerry a few flyers about bear safety.","New","Madera",37.3681522,"-119.5378726"

The bears are constantly breaking down our back and front fences to get to our next door neighbors garbage cans. We have had to repair these fences on numerous occasions.  Our neighbors are an apartment building complex and this complex does not have bear proof garbage cans. These bears have also damaged our crawl space under our cabin on numerous times so we installed an electric bear door to stop this and this worked.  We sometimes get 3 or 4 bears a day going through our property on our ring camera video. They are starting to come through our property during the day which they did not do before. They sometimes fight on our property at night and they bringing garbage from the apartments to eat and litter on our property. They are a nuisance and are becoming less cautious of humans. We would like the authorities to order the apartment complex to install  bear proof garbage cans so we can deter these bears from damaging our fences. We are afraid of staying at our cabins at the moment because there is so many bears on our property. We have video footage to prove this. We also have video footage of the bears accessing the  apartment complex garage cans  through our fence.","Active","El Dorado",38.9560455,"-119.9475819"

I called the police back when he prevented access to my car. He has been reported by the house daily since then. Early this morning, the bear broke my bbq.

As Mr. DeCamp was climbing out of the creek he turned and came face to face with a black bear.  The animal appears to have been resting in the shade by the creek and did not heard Mr. DeCamp approach.  The startled bear reached out and struck Mr. DeCamp a glancing blow causing him to lose his balance and tumble back down into to creek.  Mr. DeCamp fell and hit his head on a rock losing consciousness.  Mr. DeCamp is not sure how long he was out however, when he awoke the bear was nowhere to be seen.  Mr. DeCamp was able to make his way down the trail to his car.  From there he travel to Mercy Hospital in Redding.  Mr. DeCamp was diagnosed with a concussion and has several broken orbital bones around his left eye.

Sgt. Avalos advised his agency had received information of a possible bear attack that had occurred in South Lake Tahoe on Friday night, 07/31/20. Initial information indicated a bear had broke through a screen door and entered a residence located at 1954 Marconi Way. Additional information indicated an adult female had come in contact with the bear, where an injury had been sustained.  I was additionally advised South Lake Tahoe Police Department had initially responded to the incident.  Following the notification from Eldorado County Animal Services, I contacted my immediate chain of command and began making additional inquiries into the incident.I contacted the South Lake Tahoe Police Department,  where I confirmed Officers had responded to a bear incident at 1954 Marconi Way on 07/31/20.  I was advised that Officers arrived on scene at approximately 2206 hours and departed the residence at 2220 hours. South Lake Tahoe PD further advised the victim was transported to Barton Hospital, South Lake Tahoe.  South Lake Tahoe PD provided incident numbers: 2007-3895 and 2007-3896 related to their response. I was additionally advised a report had not been taken.During initial inquiries, I also received a report that had been taken by Eldorado County Animal Services, incident number: A28096778, dated: 08/01/20 at: 1115 hours. I briefly reviewed the report and noted that the bear referenced had reportedly clawed the victims right lower leg. It was also indicated that the bear appeared habituated to humans and had growled at the residents during the incident.I was unable to reach the victim by phone and responded to South Lake Tahoe to acquire additional information. I arrived at 1954 Marconi Way, South Lake Tahoe at approximately 1835 hrours on 08\02\20. An adult female, later identified as the victim: Anne Demma, was present in front of the residence upon my arrival. Also present was Demmas’  spouse who identified himself as Mark Duvall.Demma and Duvall advised The incident had occurred approximately 10 minutes prior to the arrival of Officers, indicating approximately 2156 hours on 07/31/20.Demma stated she had been in the upstairs bedroom and their two daughters were in the downstairs bedrooms when she heard a noise from the kitchen area. Demma further stated, she had started walking down the staircase and stopped before reaching the bottom when she noticed a bear in front of the kitchens' refrigerator. Demma stated and later demonstrated, she had stopped at approximately the fourth step before reaching the floor.Demma stated she yelled to her husband Duvall, upon seeing the bear. Demma stated the bear then began to move in her direction. Demma indicated the bear stopped at the base of the stairway, where it scratched her right lower leg with its’ front claws. I confirmed with Demma that she had been standing approximately four steps from the bottom of the stairway when the bear made contact with her and she indicated yes. I additionally clarified that the bear did not walk up the stairway and Demma indicated yes. Based on the  description of the incident, it appeared the bear was able to stand, extend and reach Demma while standing on the floor. Demma and Duvall indicated they then yelled at the bear and it exited the residence through the back sliding door and onto the rear decking that extends behind the residence.Based upon statements given, and inspection of the rear sliding door; I concluded the sliding glass door had been left open and the screen door had been shut. There was an obvious tear in the screen netting, indicating the bear had pushed through the screen to access the residence. While inspecting the decking that extended beyond the rear sliding glass door, I noticed a dried dark colored substance upon its' surface. The substance appeared to be liquefied fecal matter that had dried. I asked Duvall if he had noticed the substance before the bear incident and he said no. I asked Duvall if he had noticed the substance following the bear incident and he indicated yes. Duvall stated that when he noticed the substance it appeared shiny and liquefied.  Based on its Appearance and the time frames given, it appeared the suspected fecal matter had likely originated from the bear. Upon the decking, I Additionally located a bears'  foot print. Duvall advised that while exiting the residence, the bear appeared to make a growling type sound. Duvall stated the bear then crossed the decking and jumped over a walking gate that extends down a small stairway. Duvall indicated an area where the bear had crawled beneath the decking after exiting the residence. Based upon other agency reports and witness statements, the bear did not remain beneath the deck and was not present when Officers arrived that night. I looked beneath the decking with a flashlight and saw what appeared to be a large bedding area on the ground .I additionally located a single hair upon the outer edge of decking.When asked to describe the bear, I was advised the bear was approximately 5 feet in length from nose to tail. The bear was also described as black or dark brown in color. Based on statements given and the foot print size,  it appeared the offending bear was likely average sized, possibly weighing between 200 and 300lbs. During evidence collection, I used a wet swab to recover potential DNA from the footprint.  I additionally collected fragmented samples and a wet swab of the presumed dried bear fecal matter.  The single hair upon and edge of decking and multiple hairs from the bedding area were also retained for DNA testing.  Clothing worn by Demma during the incident that had come in contact with the bear had been since washed and were not retained for evidence. Photographic evidence of the injury sustained by Demma were provided to me by Duvall. I advised Duvall the incident would be further evaluated.  Duvall was cooperative and consented to the placement of a trap if needed. On 08/03/20, I delivered the evidence samples to the Wildlife Forensic Lab in Sacramento for DNA identification, where a genetic profile for a female CA Black Bear was later recovered. As a response, I, and members of LED and WLM placed two traps from 08/04/20 through 08/07/20, where the target was not located.","Active","El Dorado",38.9300997,"-120.0175574"

The last thing I want to do is kill this bear. Ideally I could be around when he is and haze him with rubber bullets or shoot over him with bird shot repeatedly and maybe get him in the rear end after he runs quite a distance away to sting him with some shot. It is my belief that this is the bears first year away from his mother (as he is no more than 70 pounds) and he is attempting to establish his boundaries and find all resources within his boundary. This is what I have done: I have locked bear boxes both at the home cabin and the rental (he recently has tried x2 to get into the home cabin box unsuccessfully), I provide ""Keep me wild"" information to the renters and even have a poster hanging by the door that instructs how to avoid bear human conflict. I strongly educate renters about LNT principals and food reward concerns that may bring the bear coming back and the renters have all been very good about this. Again, my goal is to be around when the bear is and haze him but I also want to be able to defend myself/family and puppy if I need to.

I watched as the bear approached a vacant tent that was set up in the adjacent site.  The bear stood up on its hind legs next to the tent and jumped onto the top of the tent calapsing it to the ground.  I approached the bear to about 30 yards.  The bear noticed me and stopped, I shot the bear in the front shoulder with one bean bag round from my shotgun.  The bear ran out of the camp sites and into the brush.  The bear continued running in a large circle around camp and stopped near the river approx. 50 yards from a couple and a dog.  I went to the location and yelled at the bear which finally left the area.  Another subject last saw the bear cross the river and walk up the bank and disappear into the forest.At approx. 1730 hrs., I returned to the parking lot of the camp to see if the bear had returned.  Upon entry to the parking lot I saw 4 females gearing up to ride motorcycles.  I spoke to the females who told me they had just seen the bear approx. 10 minutes prior to my arrival.  The group told me the bear had gotten into the back of a pickup and grabbed something and ran off into the woods.  The group pointed out the pickup which was still parked in the same location.  I loaded up less lethal rounds into my shotgun and inspected the pickup.  The pickup had a large amount of dried blood in the back and one dried fish fin.  The truck also had one large commercial sized blue fish tote in the bed.  I waited in the lot and videoed the bear as it entered the back of the truck and tried getting into the blue tote.  I was unable to haze the bear with the shotgun so I walked towards the bear yelling at it.  The bear exited the truck and ran into the woods.  Shortly there after, the owner of the truck showed up.  The owner showed me a blue fin tuna head that was from a recent catch.  Fish blood and fish heads were what he had in the bed of the truck.  The owner left the parking lot in his truck.  I stayed ready for the bear to return.  About 10 minutes later the bear returned to the parking lot where I was waiting with less lethal bean bag rounds.  I shot the bear with one bean bag round at approx. 5 yards in the front shoulder.  The bear immediately turned and ran back into the woods.  I shot the bear one more time with one bean bag round in the rear end while it was retreating.  I never saw the bear again that day.","Closed","Del Norte",41.7420019,"-123.9807109"

I was told a black bear had struck an adult male resulting in an injury at that address. Upon my arrival I met with the victim, later identified as Eric Matises (DOB 9-6-68). I saw he had a bandage on his right forearm. He told me the following in summary. On 7/26/2020 at approximately 0030 Hours, Matises heard a noise on the downstairs level of his residence. He thought it might be a bear breaking something on the back porch or a downstairs window. He walked to the glass slider door at the rear of the house. He turned on the light and saw a bear standing in the partially opened slider doorway. He said the bear had both his front feet inside the house, with the remainder of the bear’s body still outside the door. Matises reached for the slider door handle with his right hand in order to close the door. As he did the bear swiped at him with an unknown front arm, contacting Matises’s right forearm and creating a deep open wound. Matises immediately jumped back. He picked up a chair from the dinning room and threw it at the bear still standing in the doorway. The chair struck the bear. The bear then backed out of the doorway and exited the house. Matises was then able to close and lock the slider door. Matises claimed the bear remained on the back porch for about 30 seconds before leaving out of sight. Matises then lost conciseness falling to the kitchen floor. Matises’s wife then called 911. She did call them back and cancel their response once Matises regained conciseness and claimed he was ok. I asked Matises if the slider door had been open prior to the bear making entry. He claimed it had been closed completely, but they had obviously forgot to lock it. He claimed the bear had to have opened it. I looked at the sliding glass door and saw if was functioning properly. I saw two fresh bear paw prints on the glass of the slider. I asked Matises what the bear looked like. He claimed it was a bigger bear, in the 300 pound range. He claimed it was cinnamon in color with no other distinct markings and no visible ear tags. He claimed they were used to seeing bears in the area, but had never seen this particular bear before. After my initial interview with Matises I photographed the area where the encounter with the bear had happened. I then took swabs of saliva at the base of the slider door. I collected a hair sample found on the inside of the slider door. I collected a hair sample stuck in the wood trim near the slider door. I later provided these samples to the wildlife forensics lab. Through out my interview with Matises he refused any additional medical treatment. He also strongly stated he was not afraid of the bear and he believed it was not aggressive at the time of the incident. I recommended he seek medical attention for his wound. He then told me he would seek medical advice in the morning and contact my department if he decided to go to the hospital. I then left the residence and briefly searched the local area. I saw no bears in the area at that time. Matises went to Tahoe Forest Hospital on 7-26-20 at approximately 0930 hours. He was treated for a laceration to his right forearm and received multiple stitches. Warden Tessler photographed the wound and collected the bandage originally used to cover the wound. The bandage was then provided to the wildlife forensics lab for analysis.","Closed","Placer",39.0657887,"-120.148418"

I then yelled at him as he continued walking slowly away and up the hill into the woods. No damage other than the screen torn to bits. I went around to several of the nearby cabins and let one of the cabin owners that i found to watch out and let others know if he sees anyone. The next day Sunday evening @ 7:00 pm we were outside next to the cabin towards the front sitting at the outside picnic table when i noticed the bear sneaking around the same window of the cabin. My wife jumped into our pickup truck nearby and i started yelling at him. He certainly wasn't in a hurry as he walked up the hill turning around several to smell and look at me. I carry a 9mm concealed carry pistol (Im a legal card carrier of course) on me at all times especially at the cabin . Probably wont do much good if he attacked me, but i was prepared to send a couple of shots in the air if he decided not to leave. We left for home the next morning and i came back on Wednesday 7/29/20 to see if he had come back and tried to get into the cabin. I found the back door screen tore up where he tried to get in. He also turn a plastic trash can with a sealed lid (not used for household garbage) turned over. He is big enough to tear the door down but hasn't so far.

I secured the gate to prevent the bear from re-entering my coop.On 07/31/20, between 0100 hours and 0600 hours, a bear gained access to my enclosed chicken coop again.

"WIR-2020-002236","7/22/2020 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","My husband, 5-year-old son and I were sleeping in a tent at site 41, Pi Pi campsite, Eldorado Forest. At night, around midnight, I heard a loud noise of breaking sticks in the bushes. Then I heard huffing (maybe 4 times), which sounded like a bear. When I heard that it entered our campsite, I woke up my husband and used flashlight. It started to move along the forest line. When it got silent, I went to the car and locked the door. After some time, I saw a siluette of a bear behind our screen house, which we put over the table. I had left a spotlight hanging there. Then the screen house started to move. It probably tried to lift it. Came back and did that for maybe two more times. Then started scratching(?) the log that was lying near the screen house. Later went to check BBQ. Was going all around the campsite, so I was afraid it would go to the tent where my husband and son were sleeping. I used flaslight every time. When I thought that it finally went away, it went around the bushes and tried to open the doors of my car. It was tapping the doors from front to back and then from back to front again. I tried to use flaslight again. I read about bears, so we tried to keep the campsite clean, change clothes before sleeping, etc. There are no bear boxes, so the food was stored in an air tight box in the trunk of the car. The bear stayed in the camp all night and left only when the sun started rising. Then I went to WC and checked if there were any footprints. I found marks in all those spots where I saw it, including near the doors of my car. We found also the marks of claws under the front door handle. The log had fresh parts lying around. When I followed the prints, I saw scatered grapefruit(?) peels under the bushes. Probably previous campers left them there. The soil was disturbed around that spot. That's where I heard the bear first. We also found a couple of piles of excrement in our campsite. Again close to that spot. One seemed to be older, another fresher, but I don't think it was left that night. There were seeds inside, so they could be bear's. The log was also damaged when we first arrived, so it looks like the bear visited that campsite not for the first time. There are small creeks at the side of the campsite. Bears may be using those for travelling. I'm not a specialist, but there could be game trails going to the campsite. Berry bushes, nut trees. I'd say that campsite could be on the way where bears visit. But such behavior may also indicate that the bear has tried human food before or is feeding somewhere on garbage. When the main garbage containers get full, I saw the hosts put garbage bags in a cart. I wonder where they take them. If there is a garbage dumpster somewhere in the forest and bears go there, they could be putting the campers at risk. What if it opened the car door? What if it went to the tent? What if my husband got out of the tent and it attacked him? I told one of the hosts, but she looked very ignorant. When my husband went to get the firewood, he said that one of the hosts looked drunk. I saw the same observation in one of the campsite reviews. I told about the garbage that I found under bushes, but she seemed not to care. I don't think they'll clean it. We reserved the place for 2 nights, but in the morning we packed all our stuff and left.","New","El Dorado",38.5738883,"-120.4179046"

Had many interactions with bears in the past, mostly with the trash bin (which is locked). This bear this season has been more challenging. He has stood his ground; roaming all around our house; attacking and destroying parts of our chicken coop on two different occasions, which had be in existence for over 7 years -- no other bear had gone near them. This bear is not scared; hazing has not worked effectively with this one. He stands his ground. On two occasions he's attacked our chicken coop in darkness, tearing down one side of the coop and attacking some chicks, killing at least 2; carcasses laying around. Has walked away with one of the feed boxes, which was behind a fence. As far as the tree involved, in one night, he managed to eat every single fruit on a loquat tree, breaking at least 2 mature branches. I'm mostly afraid of my apiary; I have two colonies of bees in my backyard, which have not yet been targeted by this mischievous bear.I want to protect my property and livestock.

In that length of time we have many beat encounters... inside our cabin, car, outside the cabin as well as a mama bear and her cubs several years ago who decided to make the underneath area of the cabin home for the winter. She did get inside but the damage was pretty minimal. We called the Bear League and they recommended we put up the electrical wire around the cabin, which we did. I only tell you all of this to preface that we are not big over-reactors to bears and attempt living with them peacefully.However, this year, there is what we (and the year-round neighbors) think is an orphaned juvenile in our neighborhood . He or she seems to have exactly ZERO fear of humans. He/she comes by our cabin frequently. Most recently, my sister and her family were enjoying dinner on our deck when he showed up and despite the fact there were 8 noisy people on the deck came right up on to  the deck... there were 3 children under 5, the best thing they could do was run for cover in the cabin and watch him eat what ever was left on the table... they did not have time to grab the food as they fled inside. When pots and pans were banged all the bear did was look nonchalantly and continue chowing.We have taken all the  precautions suggested online as well as by the Bear League but this situation has us all spooked as this bear is currently young , so he's cute. When this bear finishes growing he will be a huge treat to anyone that lives in what he thinks of as his feeding grounds. We worry most about the young children, obviously, they don't play alone outside but even with a parent outside with them there is a real danger from this bear.Thank you for your time.Gina jacobs858-245-9138","Closed","Placer",39.2373982,"-120.0702661"

I have reported this to Wildlife fish and game before.::8/18/16 (This is what I sent in 2016) Received NO RESPONSE. Hello, I just wanted to alert you to a severe Bear problem at Pine Mountain Club (near Frazier Park). We have a getaway place there that my family have had for 40 plus years. We have NEVER seen a bear there until the last 1-2 years. My place backs up to the forest, and now I see the bears DAILY. My next door neighbor feeds and waters them, as do others at PMC, which has them coming down the mountain daily. They are sleeping outside my mobile home every night and at her place. I have pictures of some bears and of the over $1,000.00 damage they caused to our mobile home, by pushing in the side of the wall. We have called security and the PMC Clubhouse on several occasions to report the numerous bears and about neighbor feeding them, and they say there is nothing they can do to the people who are feeding them unless they see it with their own eyes! Apparently someone shot and killed a bear on 8/7/16 due to it charging them. A neighbor kid told us, ""you know who is feeding them."" Pointing to our next door neighbors house. I have asked her several times to stop feeding/watering them so they will stop coming around, but she says its because of the drought and they are just desperate. That is probably true, but if she and the others would STOP they would learn to forage in the woods or lakes or wherever. She believes she is helping the neighbors or they would be breaking in to more homes looking for food and water. This situation with the bears is so bad, and nothing seems to be done about the situation. Can the bears be relocated or something? Several people are very upset about the lax stance that is being taken regarding feeding/watering bears. Is there anything that can be done or can this information be forwarded to the department that has jurisdiction over this problem. I would like to have my identity kept anonymous, as I don't want to become a target of the neighbors who believe the bears are ""harmless."" The man that shot the bear has already become a target of a petition by neighbors to have him arrested, even though Fish and Game declared the shooting ""justified.""

As I was at the end of my hike, on the last mile or so right after the point where the trail connects back to itself but before I got to the gate with barbed wired fence and young bear started to walk out of the bushes to cross the trail (trail is about 12 feet wide) to head to the water.  In those 3 seconds I first thought maybe it was a cow or a giant pig, maybe a boar. It was too short to be a cow (on all fours was about 4 feet tall) and had no tusks like boar. I screamed ""holy Jesus, what is that?"" - it took about 3 steps out of the bushes, and when it heard and saw me it turned right around and and ran back into the bushes. I stopped and could see the top of the bushes move and saw how far back it ran, I even heard a few wild turkeys it disturbed, and I knew I had to hurry up and get out of that area very calmly. As I walked by I realized a few things - it's body was short and round and had a big but, not like a pig with a long torso. It was all brown, no spots like a pig, and it never made a sound or squealed. I know the difference between a mountain lion and a bob cat, I am an experienced hiker, and that was definitely a bear. This spotting is about 1/2 mile from residential homes in Moraga, CA (Contra Costa County). I saw it right at the gate walking from the East headed to the reservoir. It is outside the gated area, before the gate and before the trail splits to either go up the ridge or near the reservoir.  I called the Moraga Police Department and they told me animal control does not deal with bears. They gave me your number, but it was after hours. Please re-home this bear, these are popular trails (don't want it to wander off into Redwood Regional Park in Oakland) and it will scare other hikers - we only have some many outside actives to do during COVID-19. I have notified All Trails and I will notify the local news paper in Moraga too.  Please keep me updated with this situation. That area is too close to residents on one side and too close to popular trails on the other side.","Closed","Contra Costa",37.8175768,"-122.1331288"

On June 25, 2020 at approximately 1300 hours, I received a call from SUCROM dispatch and a San Bernardino County Sheriff Sergeant regarding a bear in a resident’s backyard tree at 31308 Carson Street, Lucerne Valley, CA 92356. I arrived on scene approximately 40 minutes later and located the bear hiding in the tree. Due to location of the home and the local residence periodically driving/stopping to observe the bear, hazing the bear and hoping it would run towards the foothills was not a sound plan. I contacted Chanelle Davis and requested assistance in immobilizing the bear and returning it to the forest. Davis arrived to the location at approximately 1730. Davis shot the first dart at 1827 hours while the bear was standing at the base of a tree. After the first dart, the bear climbed approximately 20 feet up into the tree. After observing the bear and seeing no signs of the drugs taking effect, I shot a second dart which Davis made with her drugs at 1854 hours. I shot a third dart created by Davis at 1930 hours. A fourth dart was created by Davis and I shot the dart into the bear at 2017 hours. The drugs started to take effect while the bear was still in the tree. The bear did not attempt to climb down the and was going to remain up in tree. San Bernardino County Fire was called to assist with accessing and lowering down the bear. Once SB Fire arrived on scene, they climbed up to the bear, administered a final dose of the immobilization drug by hand and began to work on lowering the bear safely. Davis informed me that Jeff Villepique advised the bear should be released in Holcomb Valley, a portion of the San Bernardino Mountain Range that borders Lucerne Valley. Once the bear was lowered to the ground, SB County fire for an unknown reason, placed the bear on oxygen after they believed the bear was “not breathing.” The bear was tagged (#2571) and I transported the bear to a portion of Holcomb Valley not used by the public (34.2929109, -116.9156436).

He also caused the burners on our electric stove to turn on. Fortunately at the time nothing was left on top of the stove by the bear that could have started a fire. We repaired the damage but did not report it.When we again returned on June 15th we discovered that we had another or possible two additional break ins. The back door was torn off the hinges and the dead bolt was torn out of the wall destroying not only the door but also the frame and part of the wall. The dead bolt was even bent. This time the damage was worse. The frig will have to be replaced and there was food all over a section of carpet in the living room. The stove burners(controlled by push buttons on the front) were again on and red hot.The reason I felt we may have has an additional break in is the fact that sections of the Front Door had large pieces of wood ripped out by claw marks and the large window in the door was broken out. A number of other homes in our immediate area have also had break ins with similar damage.I have pictures of the damage and a video of the bear that returned while we were there repairing the damage.

We try everything to scare her off, bells, screaming  etc and she basically retreats to her spot on the hill and that's about as far as we get. Its slightly uncomfortable when they are not there because at least then we know where they are.  We had friends come the other day for dinner and their kids brought their bikes. We went to take them out of the garage and load them up and got detained for 15-20 minutes saying goodbye. When we came out she was in our garage grabbing the extra trash bag we had next to our bin.  We have a bear box but we cannot take everything down immediately.  She kept the bag with her when we startled her and dragged it slightly up the hill where we found out her bear cub had climbed a tree.  Our guests had to wait for about an hour for her to leave. We scared her enough to retrieve the trash but of course she was not going to leave with her cub up a tree. When he did come down they just went a little ways up the hill and took their usual spot.  I have reported them before and then there were 2 cubs. This time we only saw one.  I have small children and do not let them outside unless we are in large groups supervised.  The Bear league told me to yell scream make her afraid of me and believe me we have tried everything and I can assure you she is not afraid of any of us.

As satisfying as it may be to get rid of him once and for all I’m sure there is something a warden can do about it. As far as trapping or relocation . This bear visits my house EVERY day and night . Any hour of the day he could show up. She has shown up right behind me when I’m at the BBQ On the deckI believe she is the mother of 3 cubs in my area .I’d estimate between 350-400 poundsEars far apartCinnamon in colorShe’s easily scared away but turn around and comes back in short time 15min or so I am afraid she is learning that I am no threat .Until I’m in a position that I will be her biggest threat ever.

I arrived on scene and the bear was GOA (gone on arrival).  I (Warden Aaron Burger) provided verbal information to the tenant and left the area.  I never saw the bear.  The owner had photos of the bear in her trash can and standing up and looking into her windows.05/19/20 - A call came in at approx 1400 hrs that a homeowner at 11937 Oceanview Lane (Approx. 1.5 miles away) in Smith River was inside his house and had a black bear inside his laundry room.  I (Warden Aaron Burger) responded to the location and made contact with the RP.  The bear had left the residence and was GOA (gone on arrival).  The RP showed me where the bear entered into the laundry through a door to the outside.  There was no visible damage to the house or door.  The RP/resident of the property was given verbal information on hazing options and was instructed to clean up trash located at the property.  As I was leaving the property I noticed a walking trail into the dense woods.  The trail was next to the property owners mailbox and driveway entrance.  Also located at this location was a tipped over trash can and trash debris up the trail.  I waited at this location for approx 10 minutes when the black bear came down the trail towards my location.  I stood at the trail and yelled at the bear.  The bear did not leave and slowly advanced down the trail towards me.  At approx. 1440 hours, I shot the bear with a 12 gauge bean bag (non-lethal) round.  The bear immediately turned and ran into the woods.  I continued to yell at the bear as it ran off into the forest.I decided to sit at the driveway entrance in case the bear returned.  At approx. 1520 hours the bear returned and at 1523 hours I shot the bear again with a 12 gauge bean bag (non-lethal) round.

Myself and Warden Swaney were responding, but over an hour away.  The Sheriff’s Department went to the residence and met with the reporting party, Bruce Batten, and they were unable to locate the bear and canceled us.  I called the reporting party and he stated that earlier that day he was weed eating near his residence.  Batten has three German Shepards that were out on the property with him.  Batten stated that the bear walked right near were he was and that was it.  Batten stated that he has lived on the property for over four years and never seen a bear.  Batten enjoyed seeing the bear and didn’t think anything of it.  Batten lives in a very small shack and had a bag of trash outside his residence that he hauls off according to him.  Batten had dog food in the shack.  At approximately 2100 hours on the 17th he heard a noise outside. He opened his door and noticed a bear 15 feet from his door going through the bag of trash.  The dogs were barking and he starting using a loud whistle he had, while waiving his arms around to attempt to scare the bear.  Batten stated the bear just looked at him.  Batten then stated he shut his front door, at which point the bear was pushing against the door to open it.  Batten activated his car alarm and the bear left.  Batten got in his car and left the property.  I spoke with him on the phone and we discussed making sure any all attractants and trash were gone from the property.At around 0200 hours on 5/18 Batten called 911.  Batten reported that he woke up to his dogs going nuts and the front door shaking.  Batten stated that he wedged stuff under the door and was pushing with all his mite to keep the door shut.  Batten set his car alarm off again and noticed the bear grab another piece of trash and walk off slowly.  Batten got in his vehicle and left.  I spoke with Batten and we agreed it would be best to go out together at first light and assess the situation. Batten called me at 0600 hours.  Batten drove back to his property and noticed the bear in and out of shack.  Batten took a picture of the bear at his front door halfway in and halfway out.  Batten watched it for awhile going in and out.  Warden Swaney and I responded to the property.  Batten thought the bear was still inside.  Warden Swaney and I cleared the shack and then looked around the property.  We noticed several bear prints and some trash strewn around.  It appeared the bear had gotten into a bag of dog food inside the dwelling.  We advised Batten to remove anything inside or outside with a scent.  Batten cleaned up the trash in the yard and put it in his vehicle.  Batten reported driving straight to the dump.  I advised Batten to put anything he needed with a scent in an abandoned vehicle on the property and out of his dwelling for the time being.  Batten complied.  The thought was if we cleared the property of any attractants the bear would not continue to show up.At 1800 hours on 5/18 Batten called me stating he was fighting with the bear at his door again.  Batten stated that he drilled a hole in the door and was spraying Clorox bleach at it and it wasn’t going away.  Batten sounded very panicked and stated that he needed help quickly and to call the sheriff’s department.  Warden Swaney and I responded to the property and the bear was gone.  Batten stated that he fired up a chainsaw and the bear went away.  At the time Batten  was upset about the situation and felt scared to return to his residence and had nowhere to go.  We stayed on scene from approximately 1930 hours on 5/18 to 0530 hours on 5/19.  We did not see or hear the bear.","Active","Sonoma",38.3790555,"-122.4680619"

The location was 1013 West Maple Ave. West Maple is in between Lompoc High School and Ruth Clarence Elementary School, in a residential neighborhood. The nearest open space was approximately .75-1.0 mi away. The bear would pass through multiple blocks of residences and an elementary school to return to open space. The bear appeared to be approximately 300lbs and uninjured. Warden Magleby notified Biologist Dustin Pearce and Lt Jamie Dostal of the situation. Lt Dostal contacted Assistant Chief George Struble. Lieutenant Dostal granted permission to immobilize and move the bear. Magleby, Volheim and Lompoc PD Officers followed the bear who continued to move from yard to yard by climbing over fences and running down streets. Lt Dostal arrived on scene at approximately 06:00hours. The bear was first darted by Magleby in the alley behind West Apple Ave and was able to be contained and finally immobilized in the back yard of 916 West Apple Ave. The bear was immobilized with a total of four darts and two push-sticks of Tilzolan. The bear appeared to be in good health and uninjured. The bear was tagged in the left ear with a red ear tag #23 and secured for relocation at approximately 07:35 hours. The bear was relocated to Vandenberg Air Force Base (34.5629, -120.5308) approximately 7 air miles away after Wayne Moses, Chief Conservation Officer, of the base granted verbal permission.

We let them roam about in a fenced run area during the day, but put them into an enclosed barn at night for their protection. The attack occurred while they were enclosed in the barn. My Son approached the barn in the morning to let the chickens out for the day, and he heard loud rustling. He was unarmed and most of us were not home. After seeking assistance from our neighbor, upon returning, the bear had gone. There were still a couple of chickens hiding in the barn under some straw, and most had escaped into the run area. Five were completely missing, one was dead and one was injured (slashed open wing). We moved them temporarily into our home to protect them until we resolve the issue.The Bear had entered into our fenced pasture where we have the chicken coop. It is enclosed by metal rail fencing and chicken wire. This is where the enclosed barn is where the chickens slept at night. The gate to the outside area of the chicken coop was damaged and it climbed through while still chained shut. It had also tore off an electrical box from the wall while attempting to open the gate. It ripped the ramp door off of its hinges and entered the enclosed barn.We moved in last spring, and had a few bear encounters with our trash bins. We were told by the forest service station personnel to use Ammonia in and around our trash to deter the bears. This works and we have not had an issue since. If it continued, we would purchase the bear lids from El Dorado Disposal as a resolution.Our dogs usually alert us when there are unwanted critters around in the middle of the night. We had a bear knock down our back yard fence. Since then, when they alert us, we use an air horn, also recommended by the forest service personnel. This usually works. We believe they heard things happening that night, and we tried to use the air horn, but they continued to bark.We have just found that prior to moving in the previous owner's pet alpaca was brutally attacked and killed by a bear, and that a bear tore the door off of their motor home and ransacked it.Killing our animals is not acceptable and is heartbreaking to our family.

Due to his training and experience with bears, Deputy Bjorn retuned to his patrol vehicle and retrieved his Remington 870 shotgun. Deputy Bjorn returned to the porch of the residence to scare the bear once again.  The bear ran from him and returned back to the chicken coop.

This current bear has stuck around for months and pulled down fences around orchards, broken large limbs off of dozens of fruit trees and flat out destroyed a few, when we went up this last weekend we found damage to both of the screened in porches of the house, damage out in the shed and muddy paw prints on the front door from an attempt to gain entry into the house itself. We have attempted to deter the bear by repairing the fences and putting up solar powered IR sirens/strobes in certain areas to deter it, in some cases it has caused it to move to other areas but in other cases its just knocked them over. We have also tried stripping the trees of fruit early and giving up on anything for the year to try to deprive him of an easy food source and encourage him to move on. I had hoped with the onset of winter and a lack of most of the fruit it would move on but it does not seem interested in doing so. It toppled and destroyed a grouping of 20-25ft caucasian persimmons. It also damaged a number of the neighbors bee boxes located next to our largest orchard several months back. I need to get rid of this bear before it finally decides to break into the house.

Once the officer, was on the scene and assessed the situation we opened the rear hatch of our vehicle using the key fob from our house.

The steering wheel was bent, all the seats were ripped up, the console, electronics, headliner, dash, windshield, etc. all destroyed. We notified our insurance and they towed the vehicle to a location to be assessed. The vehicle was deem to have too much damage to be fixed and was totaled. This is a vehicle that cost $60K and was in EXCELLENT condition.

RP stated the bear is seen there often and was currently ""sleeping"" underneath a deck by the marina. RP advised the bear was near a public space where people often walked their dogs, and did not appear to be afraid of human interaction.We arrived at Pine's Marina at approximately 1030 hours. We could not locate the RP, but talked to another Pine's Marina manager. The manager, Mike, told us the bear had already left. He told us the sheriff's department had been there and scared the bear away with their vehicle sirens. Mike said he was concerned because people frequently walk through the area with their dogs, and the bear did not seem to be afraid of people. Mike showed us where the bear had been. There was a patch of dirt which appeared to have been disturbed by a large animal underneath one of the marina decks. There were numerous piles of feces which were large and appeared to be from a bear. One of the piles, located next to the disturbed dirt, was fresh. Mike told us the bear is seen in the area often, and can be identified by a ""broken"" tooth. Mike said the tooth protrudes out of the bear's mouth at an odd angle. Mike told us the bear is known to go through the trash bins from the restaurant next door, Ducey's. We observed a large trash bin with its lid sitting open between Pine's Marina and Ducey's. There was a small pile of what appeared to be bear feces next to the bin. Mike told us all of his coworkers were aware the bear is often seen in the area. We recommended Mike install chicken wire around the base of the deck to deter the bear from sleeping underneath it. We also told Mike he should try to keep his trash locked up so the bear cannot access it. We contacted the manager of Ducey's about the trash issue. She told us there is a bear that comes around ""six days a week"" and causes a mess. The manager told us the bear goes through the trash and throws it everywhere. We asked the manager if she has tried putting locks on the bins. She told us the bear knows how to open the lids to the trash containers and will break them if they are locked. She also told us the bear will turn on the hot water by manipulating a water spout. The manager told us the bear is smart, and knows when the restaurant takes out its trash. The bear has commonly been seen wandering the area around closing time, and waits for them to leave before getting into the trash. The manager told us the trash is picked up twice a week. The bear will then make a mess rifling through the trash, which employees will find the next day. The manager told us all of the employees in the restaurant were aware of the bear and watch out it for it. We advised both Mike and the manager of Ducey's to call Fish and Wildlife or local sheriffs if the bear came back or was causing a nuisance.","Closed","Madera",37.320124,"-119.5566869"

I was told to respond immediately, and that Warden Elliot would also be responding. Warden Elliot called the RP/victim who was identified as JESSE DAVIS, DOB 12-20-1980. Warden Elliot gathered the following information from DAVIS:The incident occurred at approximately 0200 hours. DAVIS had left trash on his porch and woke up and went outside to investigate a commotion he heard while only wearing his boxer shorts. He opened his front door, and saw a bear going through his trash, and yelled at it. The bear then became scared and either stood up or jumped at him, scratched him, and then ran away. By the time Warden Elliot was able to speak with DAVIS, DAVIS had already been treated at the hospital with a tetanus shot. DAVIS had also cleaned his wounds, making it impossible for me to collect DNA from his wounds.At approximately 1400 hours, I arrived at 257 Manzanita Road, Mammoth Lakes, 93546. DAVIS showed me the location of the incident which occurred at the front door of his apartment (apartment 1A). I asked DAVIS to tell me what happened from start to finish. DAVIS told me in summary:At approximately 2 AM I heard a commotion at my front door. I looked out the window and saw a bear going through my trash, which I had left on the porch. I opened the front door and while standing in the doorway, I yelled at the bear to leave. The bear became startled and turned towards me, placing his right paw on my chest. He scratched my ear and back with his left paw. The bear then turned and ran away, possibly to a forested area behind my apartment. In total, the incident was about 10 seconds in duration.I then took 3 separate pictures of DAVIS, documenting the scratch on his ear, back, and chest. I looked around DAVIS’ front porch for signs of bear tracks or blood but could not find any. DAVIS told me he had shoveled his front porch and other people had been there, trampling any tracks the bear would have left behind. Because this incident occurred at approximately 0200 hours, and DAVIS had cleaned his wounds, I was not able to collect any DNA evidence from the areas he had been scratched. DAVIS stated that he was wearing boxer shorts when the bear attacked him, so there were no clothing items to collect which could have contained DNA from the bear.I asked DAVIS some follow up questions and determined that what he saw was in fact a bear, that it was by itself, and it was the first bear he has seen this year (DAVIS has lived in Mammoth for 3 years). DAVIS told me that he recalls seeing the bear eating the remains from a container of store-bought ground beef. I spoke with Erin Meredith the Senior Wildlife Forensic Specialist from our Forensic Laboratory. Based on the situation, Meredith instructed me to collect the container of ground beef which will be sent to the forensic laboratory for DNA testing.Before leaving, I collected the ground been container as evidence, placing it in a paper bag. I instructed DAVIS to not leave trash on his porch, and to avoid confronting a bear if it is outside of his apartment. I also told DAVIS that he should call the CDFW immediately for any wildlife incidents or human/animal interactions, and that if there was an ongoing emergency with a wild animal, he should dial 911. DAVIS told me that after the attack he went back to sleep, and reported the incident and sought medical attention after 0930 in the morning (more than 7 hours later). I asked DAVIS what he would like the CDFW to do with the bear, and DAVIS said he thought it was only startled and did not want to see it get hurt.

We received a call from a neighbor that there had been a bear breakin on Saturday night.  They believe it was a mom and 2 cubs that had been seen in the area.  They went through a window in the back door, breaking it.  They then ripped cabinet doors off, emptied the contents on the floor, also destroyed the refrigerator, emptying it onto the floor, ripping apart the shelves and drawers.  They also stood on the stove and emptied all the cupboards above that, threw a microwave on the floor, breaking it.  This comes at quite a cost to us.  We cleaned up and then had to go back to the valley for work.  I have a carpet cleaner and appliances on order.  Tried to get Bear Busters to add an electric fence, but they are too booked up to deal with it until spring.  Bears also broke into another cabin at our address.  I don't know what you do with this information.  I am not there to trap these bears myself, but have grave concerns about this mom teaching cubs to forage in cabins for food.  We keep our cabin clean, but had spices and alcohol and dry goods.  Fridge only had condiments and drinks for the most part.  It is not like I left cookies out or hadn't cleaned up after cooking.  I feel like we are under attack.  With the bears foraging in cabins instead of the woods, they have no need to hibernate.  Our cabins are there all year round.  We are in a group of 6 connected townhouses, 4 of which, for sure, have been broken into by bears.","Active","Placer",39.0683235,"-120.1335099"

Thankfully we had family members staying in a cabin nearby who went immediately over to access the damage. This is the SECOND time in a years time that a bear has broken in and done damage. This time the damage was much worse.  Not only was the DUAL pane window shattered (there was blood so the bear was cut up), the window frame and casing was ripped from side of the cabin. We just finished a kitchen remodel earlier this summer. The cabinets were open and wiped clear of food, the refrigerator door was left open and lots of items were pulled out and spread all over the floor. There was blood on the counter tops. We were informed there was a huge spot on the (1 yr old carpet) of lots of dark sticky stuff. I'm guessing syrup, peanut butter, molasses, hot chocolate etc.  I'm afraid the new carpet may be ruined. I was able to get a hold of a local handyman named Josh Crummy 805-291-1160 who let me know he'd been very busy boarding up cabins in the Rubicon area. 5 were hit in 2 days.  My husband drove up early the next morning and stopped to pick up plywood to board up all of our french doors and all 1st floor windows. He and his father spent several hours cleaning up the mess and rented a carpet cleaner.  When he left late in the day the carpet looked pretty good. We're heading back up to check on the cabin the first week of Dec. but will obviously not be able to stay there - the window will not be replaced until the spring time at which time we'll have Bearbusters out to  install electric wires on all doors and windows. We're also going to invest in the electric mats.  We were just notified a day ago the bear was breaking in to several more cabins in Rubicon and as the word spread more and more cabins were hit!!  The bear problem in the entire Rubicon area is way OUT OF CONTROL AND WE NEED HELP!!!  Almost everyone has the bear proof trash containers.  People are  scared to stay at their cabins, something is very wrong with this picture. The thought we can't enjoy our vacations homes is insane - the bears need to be shot and disposed of. I'm tired so tired of hearing ""they were here first.""  That's *&%$ bull&@#  they are a nuisance, I know we've all been told a bear can't be relocated.....okay then get rid of them. There's just too many of them and they just keep coming with their cubs.  We, as well as our neighbors are spending thousands of dollars repairing, replacing and now protecting our homes.  The bears keep returning - how do you propose to handle this problem that has become very serious and out of control? One of our neighbors was asleep and the bear broke in while she was sleeping!  She's a 65 year old women who lives half of the year in Rubicon by herself!!! She had Bearbusters out the very next day (summer of '18). Thanks for listening but we need your help!!! I have pictures if that helps any. Thanks, Maria Bizzack","New","El Dorado",39.0151119,"-120.1209254"

In the last two week alone, there have been about 15 separate incidents of a bear or bears breaking down doors or windows, entering homes and causing significant damage, as well as cars and garbage huts. One of these was our car, which we were in the process of unloading and we have had two incidents of a bear breaking in to home in the last 3 years.  Everyone in our neighborhood has done their best to eliminate attractants to avoid bear break ins.  Despite this, it has gotten significantly worse over the last few weeks, and we are at a loss as to how to deter/prevent, other than electronic mats, ""Bear Busters"" wiring.  We have sighted a mother bear and two cubs, who are clearly being trained to seek food from dwellings and cars, rather than the forest.  We worry that next year will be even worse, as the cubs will be grown, and used to seeking food from our homes and cars.   Not many of us are there full time, and I am not equipped to handle depredation even if I were to request a permit.","Active","Placer",39.0740679,"-120.1505467"

On Wednesday 10/16, the information was transferred from Sgt. Payne to Shelly Blair who passed the information to me, Warden Kemp. On 10/17, I contacted the victim, Andrea Wetenkamp, who lives at the address.Wetenkamp stated on 10/04 at approximately 1930 hours, she heard noises coming from outside her residence. She stated the sound was similar to a sliding glass door being slammed. Wetenkamp investigated the sound and found two cubs and a sow on her porch. In an attempt to shoo the bears from her porch, she began to make noise and move towards the bears. At that point, the sow started towards Wetenkamp. The sow swiped Wetenkamp on the outside on the lower half of her right leg. Wetenkamp said the three bears left her porch after she was swiped.Wetenkamp stated she has seen the bears in her neighborhood recently and they have been getting into neighbor’s trash bins.Wetenkamp stated she did not want to file a report with us and did not want anything to happen to the bears. In speaking with her, Wetenkamp stated her late husband, Gilbert Wetenkamp, shot a bear in their neighborhood. Wetenkamp stated her husband was found guilty of unlawful take of a bear and served 200 hours of community service before he succumbed to cancer. Wetenkamp stated her personal information was put on facebook and other social media sites following her husband’s citation.

There were items pulled out of the barn and scratch marks/holes in horse supplement containers. The following night, the bear forced its way into the barn for a second time and destroyed bins, tables and shelves in the barn. The following morning, we removed all horse supplements and attractants in the barn and there was no food trash inside. I secured the barn and attempted to block the bear from opening the doors. I also set up my game camera on the outside of the barn on the morning of 10/15/19. On the evening of 10/15/16 at approximately 2011 hours, the bear returned to the barn (as photographed by game camera). The bear forced its way into the barn again and tore up bags of soil and broke more items in the barn. The last picture of the bear on the game camera was at 2124 hours that night.On 10/16/19 at approximately 1945 hours, I went out to check on the horses. I saw the bear standing in front of the barn again. The bear went around the barn and chased the horses, forcing them to run through their paddocks. Two of our horses were injured during the incident. One of the horses (black with white blaze on face) ran into a metal horse panel with his face. The blow was so severe that the top bar of the panel was bent by the horses face area. The horse's nose cartilage was crushed and forced into his nostrils, which induced labored breathing. The horse was also bleeding profusely from both nostrils. The horse also sustained cuts along the front of his face. Our second horse (brown bay) also ran into the paddock metal panels and cut his face in two different spots.Our horse had to be taken to the vet, where X-Rays were taken. The vet did not know how to repair the horse's nasal cavity and advised that the horse could not be worked anymore. Our horses are working horses on our cattle ranch and that horse will most likely never work again. My concern is that the bear will continue to return and continue to endanger our horses.","Active","Plumas",39.8569564,"-120.6875235"

He said there are probably dead chickens  on the path to his chicken house this AM, he didn't have time to look. After his house, last night, it came to my house.  It broke through my field fencing, tried to pry the front door off the chicken house, when unable to do that, it tried to get in through the vents in the floor, when that was unsuccessful, it broke through the chain link pen fencing and ripped off the pop door.  It was unable to get in because he 's way bigger than the door. No chickens were killed last night but both my 25 hens and two piglets were totally terrriozed.   This bear is determined and he will get in and kill everything here if he isn't stopped. Add to that all the property damage.  This a problem bear, most likely a Tahoe bear.","Active","Sierra",39.6391631,"-120.2052905"

I looked out the window with a flashlight and saw an overturned bin which had contained an open bag of sweet COB. A nearby shed with unopened bags of sweet COB was undisturbed.I noticed my cat was staring intently out an open west-facing window, and from there I saw the opened bag of sweet COB that had previously been inside the trash bin. Dressing, I went down to the street with my cat following me to retrieve the bag. Although a little bit of sweet COB remained in the bag, most of the contents had been scattered across the hillside. There was no sign of the bear.Back at my house, I fed my cat. Usually, he will immediately want to go out a southside door. This time, he was extremely hesitant to exit the open door, and I went out myself to see if anything was out there. That was when I saw that a birdbath had water splashed around it.After yesterday's incident, I placed a bowl of ammonia in front of the trash bin that had contained the bag of sweet COB. This morning, the bowl is undisturbed. As per suggestions from last year's incidents, I'm going to try filling a balloon with ammonia and painting it with jam. Since there is the possibility that the bear is approaching from the south, I will place a balloon in that area as well as placing a balloon near the area where the trash bin is. I will also be moving all the bags of sweet COB to my garage.Please let me know if you have any questions.","Closed","Madera",37.3237555,"-119.6230874"

I live very close to Bailey Canyon hiking trail and bears are customary around here, but usually we see them late at night or early morning when it is dark. In the past two weeks, they have been out while it is still light, from as early as 5:00pm to 6:30pm to 7:00pm and up. Besides seeing the bears while it is light, which is unusual, they are also being much more aggressive than usual. Last weekend, one large bear took apart and broke a portion of a fence separating my yard and my neighbors. That same weekend, a different bear (a mother bear with tag #504) broke a different fence of mine (taking off each fence post) at 6:30 pm while it was still light. I am positive that this was a different bear because of the marker, its size, and because she had her bear cub with her as well. That same weekend, my neighbors reported a separate broken fence as well. Yesterday, 9/8, the mama bear and cub came back to my yard at 7:00pm. I am very concerned about both the time of day that they are coming around, the fact that they are coming to our backyards (which is also very unusual), the aggressive behavior, and property damage. It feels unsafe to even garden in the evening, which is when I can when I return from work.I am concerned about the bears' safety as well, since more mishaps could happen at this time between both humans and dogs, particularly when they are entering backyards during the day. I understand that these are protected species, but wanted to report this increase in unusual activity for their safety as well. If you have advice or suggestions for me, I would appreciate it. I have also contacted the local Sierra Madre police department and recorded multiple events. They suggested I contact the Pasadena Humane Society and you.

That same night it took out a portion of my neighbors fence 4 houses to the west.  This was the bear’s third visit to my can in a month.  However, it has been seen almost every single night on or in a 1mile or so radius of Noyo acres drive in Fort Bragg tearing down fences and rifling garbage cans.  The Facebook page “ Mendocino County Mountain Lions and bears” has extensive documentation on this bear’s activities over the recent weeks, including video evidence of property damage, and garbage can raids.   I have witnessed bear skat very near my chicken coop more than once.    One of those included an attempted entry through my electric fence.  The bear damaged the wires, but did not tear down the coop or get access to my poultry.   My neighbor 3 houses to the west keeps honey bees/goats/horses /chickens and according to them, the bear has been out by their bee hives as of 8/26/19 also.  They put Hotwire around the bees hoping it keeps bear out, but they are definitely worried for their livestock.  While I have had very minimal damage, and my can knocked over and gone through only  a few times, and have some bent electric fence wires.  Not that big of a deal,  I see reports that this bear is doing this pretty much every night up and down highway 20.    My goal in reporting this is to try to help figure out some ongoing solutions for the neighborhood as a whole, and to get help with this current bear who is very persistent now, and hasn’t left the neighborhood in about a month.  If there is no other solutions to encourage the bear to move on, then I am going to request a permit to remove ( kill) the bear.  That’s a very last resort, any help, education, resources you can give our neighborhood is very welcomed.  I’m happy to help pass out educational material to neighbors.","Active","Mendocino",39.4138715,"-123.7604816"

I am asking because I am absolutely tired of the bear/bears tearing up my chicken coops. So far they haven't killed any of my chickens, ducks or geese yet. This year is the worst it has ever been. The bear has torn off part of the roof on the chicken coop, boards, fencing and  last night it tore the door off one of the coops.Last year it did get in the garden but it was the end of the growing season.My dog does a pretty good job at keeping them away but they have learned if they just run rather than climb a tree.I don't mind having the wildlife around but the destruction these bears are causing is becoming to much. It does not matter if the food is put up or not. I have put bigger boards up, heavier fencing and right now I am testing barbed wire in certain parts of the pen to try and deter them from getting a good pulling angle. So any other information on what I can do is greatly appreciated.What would I need if I wanted to apply for a depredation permit?","New","Shasta",40.8168856,"-121.8940446"

I am requesting a depredaton permit for the Bear(s) that have been to my home, both entering when I was present and sleeping and another time when I was not present.Last Fall a bear entered our home and was clearly there for a number of days, destroying our pantry and causing significant damage and distress.  When I returned home I had to scare the bear away and then again in the morning and that following day.  ON July 31 I was sleeping and heard a noise and came out and found a bear looking at me about 20 feet away with its head in the refridgerator. The bear entered through a pantry window which was screwed shut with plywood but was easily able to rip it off.  I called the sheriff and they came and chased the bear away and out of the homeON Aug 1 around 5pm I saw a bear on the porch across the street rummaging around - eventually moving on.On Aug 1 the bear returned at night and was clawing at the siding on our home near.  I called the sheriff again and they came.  This time the officer was able to get a shot of rubber pellets to hit the bear - not close or direct but hopefully sending a message.Later that night around 11:30 the Sheriff and CHP came back to a neighbors and told me that the bear (not sure same one) was seen trying to break into homes and they were looking for it.This is now seriously dangerous and I would like to have these bears trapped and removed as I feel I am in physical danger for my personal self and family as well as the property damage.I would appreciate a call to discuss the process to make this happen.My cell is 925-918-2337.My email is steveklei@outlook.com","Closed","Placer",39.2925623,"-120.1277984"

First was about 3 weeks ago, heard the garbage being disturbed...have had racoons and even once an injured vulture get into the garbage, but this time, I interrupted a bear in the garbage and he ran off, but came back right away as I went back inside to get a flashlight and he/she was back. So, have been securing the garbage with straps for most nights to try to discourage the bear. Tonight, it was disturbed again, didn't see the ""culprit"" but heard a very large animal crashing through the woods...louder than when groups of deer run through the woods, and this time the neighbor's garbage was also impacted.Considering setting up a camera trap to capture one or more images of the bear, but the first ""encounter"" about 3 weeks ago was definitely a bear, I have seen them getting into garbage around Lake Tahoe and I am 100% certain that it was a bear, unless there are 4-foot tall raccoons that weigh ~100 lbs.And, the only reason I am reporting is that it is a first (well, second now) time since I first moved to Amador county.In ~ 18 years on this property, predator wildlife sightings have included bobcats (twice, 15+ years apart), and foxes, until this bear.","Active","Amador",38.3818366,"-120.6814051"

In the beginning, the bear would only come to the edges of the yard at night, then it started coming closer for the birdfeeders, pond supplies and the garbage. They removed and/or locked up everything that could be attracting it, but it still keeps returning, only now it's getting closer and closer to the back entrances. This situation has escalated to the point that this bear is now coming during the daytime, freely roaming the gardens that are attached to the house, tearing up pool and patio furniture, and roaming the atrium and outside seating areas that are directly outside large sliding screens of the living room.My parents are elderly and disabled, both unable to move quickly or to run. Yesterday at 2:00pm, the bear came into their sunroom where my father was sitting. It was less than 8 feet from him and wouldn't leave. The sunroom is attached to their bedroom, so fortunately he was able to escape unharmed. THIS TIME. This bear's behavior is becoming more and more aggressive. It no longer just roams the yard, but is now actively coming into living spaces during daylight hours, and is approaching humans. My parents are afraid to go into their own yard, to garden or to use their pool, even to take out their trash. They've had to keep their windows and sliding doors closed, because the bear now comes up right to the doors and they are afraid it will come in while they're sleeping. Now that it's started coming up to the house during the daytime, they're afraid to go outside at all. Multiple neighbors have also reported the aggression of this bear and of it roaming the cul du sac, so this fear now includes going out their own front door, as well as a neighborhood fear for the children who walk to school and play outside, even for their safety in their own backyards.My parents have a video security system, so for documentation purposes, there are multiple videos of this bear entering the outside living spaces and being at their bedroom door, including the incident yesterday afternoon.Any help that could be provided would be greatly appreciated.

We fixed the coop, added stronger hardware and made it so that no gaps were visible to get a claw or paw under. The next time he came back was a couple weeks ago, and instead breaking the hardware, he tore off pieces of wood (screws and all, believe it or not). He ate 3 chickens, and severely injured another hen, which we nursed back to health. Again, we fortified the coop (or so we thought). We were awoken this time, and ran outside to scare him off. The next day, we put the wood back together and had three different locking latches on the nesting box, the only part of the coop he was getting into. My partner is an experienced carpenter, and has lived in black bear habitat all his life. Still the bear broke 3 metal, locked latches and tore the wood off the coop, and ate another 2 chickens last night. The coop is well built-- it has cemented wooden posts in the ground, and galvanized 16 gauge square wire. He can see he tried to break the wire and was unsuccessful. I've seen this bear twice now-- he's a big male. Probably 400 lbs. I hate to do it, but we'd like a depredation permit. I think he's becoming habituated.

We know it was a bear as he left a large pile of scat near the bottom of the tree. The pears were also eaten, though they were only the size of marbles at this point. We had another pear tree damaged earlier in the week but thought that it was roosting turkeys who were too heavy for the branches. Though I do not have pictures of the branches broken by the bear, they are laying in the garden now. The bear also dug in the compost pile, and ripped the bird netting on the raspberries. We later discovered that the bear had also raided our semi outdoor pantry area which is adjacent to the kitchen. We store only sealed jars and beverages there. There were many jars pulled off the shelves and broken,  and glass everywhere. Much clean up involved in addition to trying to deodorize the area so we wouldn't have a return visit. Today (6/10/19)  a very hot day, I was on our deck and heard crunching leaves, a sound more than a deer would make. I went to investigate and there stood the bear, at 4:30 in the afternoon! at the base of the stairs to our deck.  I shouted and waved my arms and the bear did not immediately turn and run. I rang a bell located on the house wall and shouted some more and finally it ran off about 50 yards. It stopped and just looked at me as I continued to bang on pans and make as much noise as I could. It finally ran down into a gulch below our house. I feel this bear is fast becoming a nuisance. In the 35+ years I have lived on this property, I have not had an encounter this close with a bear.

We are not professional but the attacks on our colonies are almost every week and we are loosing these bees that we actually try to save. The animal would come on a weekly base and get into the small colonies (we have thousand of them) and completely destroy our equipment and the bees. We have been picking up a mess frequently and kinda crying over the poor bees. With regular bee colonies (our are super small) we could fence the bee yard (which we have done in the pass with bigger hives) but these colonies are so small and so many of them that we would have to fence the whole property (20 acres) which is not possible.

While walking the dog she observed a small bear eating something from a distance. She continued her walk and was returning back on Old Sloat Road when she heard branches breaking and noise coming from the tree line just above her.  She stopped and observed a medium size bear charging at her.  She judged the distance to be 15 feet before the bear came to a full stop. She is not certain if the bear was the same bear because the other bear appeared to be darker and smaller in size. The bear which charged her was light in color and twice in size. The bear then ran up the hill.  She believes the bear was acting unusual.At approximately 1130 hours, I contacted Tina Thorman where she told me the location where the bear had charged her. I walked the perimeter and located several bear tracks at the location.  After further review, it was determined that there was two bears in the area.  The larger bear was traveling towards her not knowing Tina was in the area.  It appears the bear was startled of her presence. The bear ran approximately 15 feet and came to a stop.  A range finder was used to determine the distance which indicated 45 feet away from and not 15 feet away.  The bear returned to its path heading the opposite direction from Tina. No property damage or human contact was made. A strong odor of what appeared to be a dead deer was present and was more than likely attracting the bears to the location. No other activity was observed or reported.","New","Plumas",39.8664182,"-120.7295843"

"WIR-2019-000216","1/19/2019 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","On January 20, 2019 at 0158 Hours I received a call from Lieutenant Mike Conely. Lieutenant Conely informed me of a bear attack that occurred outside the town Ahwahnee at approximately 2330 hours. Lieutenant Conely told me the incident possibly involved a Female bear with cubs. The Victim was being treated at a hospital in Mariposa. Lieutenant Troy Bruce and Warden Chris Girytch were with the victim at this time. See attached supplemental reports provided by Lieutenant Bruce, Lieutenant Conely and Warden Girytch. At approximately 0633 hours I arrived on scene where the attack took place at the residence of 59939 Road 601 in Nippinawasee outside of the town of Ahwahnee. I met with Lieutenant Conely, Warden Garret Lenz, USDA Trapper Chris Frietas and a male subject in the driveway of the residence. The male subject was identified as Christopher Lachawicz (DOB 04/24/1983).  Lachawicz told me he was the victim. I immediately noticed two large cuts on the right side of the Lachawicz's face. Lachawicz lifted his shirt and showed me a large compression bandage wrapped around his torso and another bandage wrapped around his right forearm. Lachawicz was wearing a black and grey flannel coat, red shorts and ankle high boots.  The house can be described as white in color with various pieces of metal tin siding. There is porch on the left side of the house with a set of motion activated lights facing to the left and right of the house. There was one blue colored SUV in the driveway. I noticed in front of the house next to the driveway was a large green metal trash container. I noticed their were paw prints consistent with a bear on the green trash container.  I further noticed around the green container was a wood pile, rubber car tires, large amounts of garbage. plastic bottles, and various trash cans filled with human and dog food related items. I also noticed a dog food bag filled with a large amount of empty beer bottles.  I asked Lachawicz how long he had lived at this house. He said (4) years. I asked Lachawicz to show me where the attack happened. Lachawicz brought me to an area in front of the house approximately (40) feet to the right of the front door. The ground around the area was composed of soft soil, sand, rock and leaf litter. Lieutenant Conely and I inspected the area for evidence of bear tracks, blood or hair.  I noticed that the ground was slightly firm but seemed undisturbed. It was difficult to locate tracks or claw marks. I was able to locate very slight indentations of suspected bear tracks in the soil. I noticed a few indentations of unidentified claw marks in the area. I also noticed various tracks the size and shape consistent with a canine. I was unable to locate any blood or hair. asked Lachawicz to explain to me what happened. Lachawicz told me last night around 2350 Hours he was inside his house. Lachawicz told me he has (2) dogs named ""Cedar"" and ""Brodie"". The dogs started barking inside the house. Lachawicz opened the front door and let the dogs outside. Lachawicz heard his dogs scuffling outside as if they were fighting. Lachawicz went outside to find his dogs. He saw his dogs wrestling around and caught a glimpse of something black with his dogs. Lachawicz told me he ""yelled at it"" and ran towards his dogs.  Lachawicz told me as he ran towards his dogs something tackled him from his right. Lachawicz said it was like a football player tackled him. Lachawicz said before he realized what happened he fell straight back on the ground laying on his back. He knew it was a bear at this time.   The bear was on top of Lachawicz trying to bite his face. Lachawicz tried to fight back and push it off of him. Lachawicz said the bear bit his stomach with its canine teeth and ran off. Lachawicz said the dogs ran off after the bear. Lachawicz went back in the house to grab his boots and a flashlight to look for his dogs. Lachawicz went across the street and saw (2) bear cubs up a large pine tree and saw the female bear up on a hill in the neighbors yard. Lachawicz looked for his dogs for approximately (20) minutes.  Lachawicz said his dog ""brodie"" came back first then ""cedar"" came back. Lachawicz called his friend Steve and told him what happened. Steve drove to Lachawicz's residence and told Lachawicz that he needed to got to the hospital. Steve then drove Lachawicz to the emergency room located in Mariposa.  Lachawicz told me he did not want to give the clothes he wore during the attack to Warden Girytch because he was afraid the bear was going to be killed. Lachawicz told Warden Lenz and me multiple times that he did not want the bear killed. Lachawicz also told me he would like to have it in writing that we are not going to kill the bear that attacked him.  USDA trapper Frietas asked Lachawicz to see his (2) dogs. Cedar had approximately (6) puncture wounds on top of its head and (1) large puncture wound on the right side of its chest. The dog walked with a limp on its right rear leg.  Lieutenant Conely swabbed the clothing worn by Lachawicz and the bite marks on Cedar for DNA and delivered the samples to the Wildlife Investigations Lab in Sacramento for analysis. On January 21, 2019 at approximately 1043 hours, the Wildlife Investigations lab determined the swabbed samples taken from Lachawicz's clothing and cedar contained DNA from the same female black bear.","Active","Madera",37.4156671,"-119.7165291"

The worker departed at approximately 8:15pm and closed the door, but did not lock it.  The worker reported the next morning that he thought he saw/heard the animal while he was there.Some time between 8:15pm and 8:30pm, the bear opened the door from the outside into the garage.  The bear entered and knocked down some recreational equipment and overturned a trash can and ate some food from a trash bag where cleaning solutions / deterrent were present.At approximately 8:30pm, the bear opened a closed but unlocked door from the garage into the house and entered on the ground floor.  My wife, Julie Lauer Wurster, children Kylie (age 5) and Addison (age 3) were upstairs.  Julie heard a door open and close and thought that worker may have returned.  Uncertain, Julie called our 50lb Bernese mix dog to go investigate with her.  Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, Julie came within feet of a ~200lb black bear.  Julie ran up the stairs and our dog remained and had a tussle with the bear.  The dog look roughed up, but did not receive any serious wounds.My wife called me and I advised her to create a barricade at the top of the stairs.  From evidence of food mess, it appears that the bear ascended at least 3 stairs towards the second floor of the house.  My wife called me (Gregg) and per my instruction banged pots and pans and fired an air horn down the stairs.  At some point, the bear opened the closed door from the house to the garage, entered the garage, and exited back outside from the door he had opened into the garage.  The same bear, we believe, exhibited aggressive behavior towards me on Nov. 27 at 10am.  I was working with power tools in the garage and stepped a few feet outside.  The bear approached me from behind and snarled and huffed at me before climbing a pine tree approximately 15 feet away.  I believe that noises I heard on the night og 12/13 at approximately 7:15pm were the bear trying to re-enter.  I went downstairs after hearing the second round of thuds and shined a light at the door, but did not see the bear.  There are scratch marks on the door the bear entered through, signs of damage where it climbed the fence, and tracks.","Active","Nevada",39.3562864,"-120.1051835"

One of the bears was on his front porch area.  RP called 911 to report a safety concern with the bear and was getting ready to shoot them.  The call was forwarded to DFW Dispatch, I followed up on the public safety bear call.  I call the RP back on the phone at approximately 1105 hours and advised him I would be en route to help with the problem.  At 1115 Hours, I advised on scene and noticed two bears running from the front yard of the residence.  I also noticed two younger bears climbing up a tall pine tree in the yard.  I contacted the RP and did a quick assessment of the yard to look for what may be attracting the bears to the property.  I noticed in the front yard and next to the front porch garbage cans  turn over with garbage spread across the yard.  I advised the RP that he would need to clean up the garbage and store the garbage in an area were the bears would not be able to access.  The RP stated he would store the cans in his garage building which was separate from his home.  The RP cleaned up the garage in the yard.  The RP was also concern for his pets and animals (pig and chickens) on the property.  I checked the chicken coop and did not noticed any feed outside.  I did not check the pig corral in the back.  I advised the RP he may want to install a hot fence to protect his animals.  I told the RP to bring his dogs in at night and to clean up the dog food that dogs don't eat.  I provided the RP the department brochure ""Keep me Wild"" for Bears and wrote down on the back the local wild biologist Robert Schaeffer and my contact numbers.  I told the RP that he needed to make sure anything that could attract the bears to the property needed to be cleaned up and that should correct the problem.  The two young bears in the tree did not come down while I was on scene.  I advised the RP that when I leave and things quieted down for the night  the bears should come back down and leave.  I told him if he had any problems to give me a call back and I would come back out.  On 12/7/18, I call Robert Schaeffer and updated him on the incident.  On 12/8/18 at approximately 0830 hours in the morning I call the RP back and followed up.  The RP told me things were good and the garbage cans were being stored in the garage.  He told me two bear returned to the property last night and were laying in the front yard driveway from 2300 hrs to 0300 hrs.  I told him I would note that in the incident and let Robert Schaeffer know.

It then tore off the slide-bolt of the inner door in the shed which leads to the chicken's coop, where it attacked the chickens.  I could hear the commotion from the house, but did not go outside.  At one point I heard a scuffle near the front door.  I looked out a window, saw a very large shadow on the front lawn and shined a flashlight out the window onto a large black bear crouching on the lawn with something laying between its front paws.  The bear turned to look toward the light for a bit, then picked up what it was eating and left the front lawn.  I could hear it a little ways up the drive, eating what it had.  Then I heard it back at the chicken house where it attacked the chickens again, causing further damage to the chicken coop portion of the shed.  This morning I went out to find a pile of feathers on the front lawn where I saw the bear last night (the feathers were from our rooster).  At the chicken pen/coop I found the remains of 3 of our hens in the pen (wings, some feet, two heads, etc.).  A little while later I heard the 2 remaining hens in some nearby brush.  They appear to be relatively unharmed.  I have managed to coax them back into the pen, and plan to pull them out of the coop tonight and stash them in a cat carrier in the garage for the night.Additionally: Have had bear/bears around since late summer, damaging two old apple trees before apples were ripe (they were climbing into the trees, pulling down branches, etc.).  We eventually stripped all the apples to stop the damage to the trees, and in the hopes that the bear would 'move on'.  We also have crabapple trees, and for the past couple of weeks have seen signs that the bear/bears have been snacking on those.Our neighbors (Russ's parents) have been having the same kind of trouble -- the bear/bears have torn the hinged door off of their shed in order to get to their trash, animal feed, etc.","Closed","Alpine",38.8248671,"-119.7841825"

At approximately 1345 hours, I arrived and made contact with the RP, Richard “Randy” Harwick. The first thing I noticed were the medically stitched lacerations Harwick sustained to the left side of his face and neck. Harwick took me into his garage and began to tell me about the incident. Harwick said he left his garage door open on the night of 09/20/18. He believes the bear walked into his garage and pushed open the interior door to his residence to gain access to the refrigerator located next to that door. As the bear entered his home, Harwick’s dogs began to bark and ran towards the front door of his residence from his bedroom, located at the rear of the house. Harwick believes the bear heard the barking and walked the opposite way. Then, the bear walked through an open room in an effort to get away from the barking. At that time, Harwick left his bedroom to see what the commotion was about. As Harwick left his bedroom, he walked directly into the bear. The bear knocked Harwick down. The bear swiped Harwick with its right front paw, striking Harwick on the left side of the face, neck and left shoulder. The bear turned around and ran the way it came from. Harwick said his doctor said the bear missed Harwick’s carotid artery by millimeters.  Before the bear exited the same door it entered the residence through, it stopped at the refrigerator and opened the door. Harwick’s son, Randall, walked to the base of the stairs and saw the bear at the refrigerator. Randall had a hammer in his hand to protect himself from the intruder and threw it at the bear. The bear turned and left the residence. Harwick sought medical attention for the five lacerations sustained to his face, neck and shoulder. Harwick received approximately 28 stitches.","New","El Dorado",38.8930094,"-119.9846207"

Driving home a few minutes ago, I witnessed 8-10 vehicles (apparent tourists to our local Oak Glen apple attractions) pulled over to the side of the road at 37888 Oak Glen Road, taking photos of an adult black bear that was no more than 5 feet from the road and approaching a car.  One driver had exited his vehicle and was taking photos with his cell phone.  I was concerned for the safety of the onlookers as well as the bear.  It seemed clear to me that the bear was confused or unafraid of the collection of cars and humans who had pulled over to observe this particular bear.Exactly one week ago at a similar time of day (late afternoon)  I observed an adult bear with two cubs climbing the fence and entering the  property at almost exactly the same location on the same property.I spoke with a Yucaipa deputy today, Paul Franklin, who recommended that I make this report to you of ""near"" human contact as described above and the probability in my opinion of threat to less than cautious tourists as well as the bear.  I do have photos and video myself of these events if viewing them would be important to how the Department considers these animals.","Active","San Bernardino",34.0581795,"-116.9764863"

I have received reports (I'm at front desk of Mt Pinos Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest office) of bear/cubs breaking in to an organized camp 2x at the junction of Mt Pinos/Mil Potrero Rd back beginning of June.   Recently she was seen at Chula Vista Campground, Mt Pinos Campground, McGill Campground on Mt Pinos.  I received a report she had broken in to 2 houses at Pine Ridge. (They were supposed to report this to you themselves, so I don't know the extent of damage, etc.)   Yesterday, Mom and 1 cub were in an open trash bin at McGill (hosts were dumping ashes, left the bin open, brought the next load in and Mom/1 cub were in bin.)  Mom got out and waited for cub quite a ways away.  Cub had some difficulty getting out of the bin.  We speculate that cub may have been injured at that point.  Mom and 2 cubs, 1 injured seen in Mt Pinos Campground this morning.   All the reports I have received say Mom is not very aggressive, she brings the cubs with her, walks right by humans without stomping, posturing, or running at people.  She seems to have been quite successful opening trash bins, even with bear bars.  No reports of cars being broken in to (we are trying to get people to put food inside coolers, inside trunks of cars....though people sometimes don't seem to understand and leave things out on their tables....)   The concerns are that one cub's hind leg is now injured (bloody and cub favoring leg, falling behind Mom's lead.)  Also, that she may get more aggressive when people become better at keeping her out of their food and we begin to have more direct interactions.  If she is breaking in to houses, that is troubling.   I have heard a story that some people in Pine Mountain Club are feeding bears.  One story that a guy provided a wading pool so that the bear would stay out of his house and keep going to his neighbor, who was reportedly feeding the bears.  I have not heard this directly.....just secondhand.   I am doing what I can to educate people about the bears, so are the hosts at the McGill and Mt Pinos campgrounds.  There is no host at Chula Vista.  Our patrols have been notified.  Hopefully the hosts can work to secure their trash cans better.

PLEASE BE ADVISED:““During this extreme drought, it is particularly important that people who visit or live near bear habitat keep their food and trash secure at all times,” said Jesse Garcia, CDFW’s Bear Program manager. “These dry conditions are forcing some bears to travel longer distances in search of food and water, and sometimes these forays lead them into populated areas where bear-human conflicts occur. Bears that become conditioned to human sources of food and lose their fear of people can be become dangerous and often must be killed in order to protect public safety.”","Closed","Lake",38.9607636,"-122.7237627"

This behavior has been going on on our block since about mid June; and has gotten more aggressive and pervasive.

On the side of the house I have a couple aluminum lidded trash cans where I store kitchen trash to take to the Refuse Disposal site. Instead I see a bear trying to get into one of the cans it knocked over. Appeared to be a small to average size black bear with a regular black brown coat. The house sits on a 3-4 foot foundation so it was just outside and below me as I was viewing it through the window. I flipped on an outdoors light and banged on the window to scare it off. Rather than immediately turning and running, it raised up and faced me and put it’s paws on the window and window sill, then turned and ran off. It didn’t appear that frightened of my presence. It’s worth noting the bear didn’t actually get the lid off the trash can. I also had a can knocked over about a week ago (also with the lid intact). I now assume that was also probably a bear.

At approximately 1210 HRS, I called RP Sue Burak to ask what had happened.  RP Burak told me she lives at 6750 Old Crowley Lk Road, approximately one-quarter mile west of Tom’s Place.  She told me the night prior, 07-10-18, when she was not home, a bear had opened her kitchen window and got into to her house.  She said the bear had pulled the refrigerator out from the wall and opened the door and then ate several food items.  The bear had got into baking flower and left very distinct tracks going into her living room.  RP Burak said the only damage the bear inflicted was to a small cabinet near her kitchen window.  I asked RP Burak if she wanted a depredation permit and she told me she did not and did not have any means of using it if she did receive one.  While on the phone with RP Burak, she told me her neighbor, John Schewchuck had also saw a bear a couple of nights earlier in this same general area.  Schewchuck was by RP Burak while I was talking with her.  I asked to talk with Schewchuck at this time.Schewchuck told me on the past Sunday, 07-08-18, at approximately 2100 HRS, Schewchuck had found a dark brown colored bear, approximately 300 lbs in his Toyota Tacoma pick up.  Schewchuck told me the bear had used the latch on the vehicle and opened the door without causing any damage.  I asked Schewchuck if he had left any food or anything the bear might have thought was food in the vehicle and he told me he had not.  Both RP Burak and Schewchuck seemed very well educated on storing food and trash to keep away from bears.  Schewchuck also told me he thought he saw this bear approximately a month ago near his residence also.  I then spoke with RP Burak again on the phone.  I educated her on electric wires/ fences to go around her windows.  I also mention putting a board with nails pointing up may dissuade the bear from coming in the window again.

Last year we had to have a bear trap set out because we confirmed a bear was indeed getting into the coop and killing birds as well as smashing fencing. Today 7/9/18 we discovered that the bear have now decided to drag our entire recycling bin up the embankment and proceed to destroy anything it found inside it. We made sure to rinse out all containers, and have been pouring bleach or vinegar over all trash to keep attracting smells to a minimum. This is happening at the top of our driveway which is about 75yards from the house. Today after leaving for work at 7am the bear decided to come down to the house and into our carport. It proceeded to take a ShopVac and rip the top off and shred the filter/bite the hose. Take a empty clear plastic tote drag it from the carport and bite/smash it. After discovering this we investigated further and that the bear had attempted to make entry through the outside garage door.

"WIR-2018-001689","7/2/2018 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","On 07/05/18, I, Warden Kemp investigated a black bear--human contact.  I contacted a witness, Gerry Orton, at a cabin located at 840 Emigrant Rd., South Lake Tahoe, CA.  Orton gave his account which closely followed the encounter Johnny Bolton, the victim, told me.  Orton was not present during most of the encounter.  During the investigation, I was informed a bear broke into the cabin by smashing a window on the night on 06/30/18.  During the investigation, I collected several samples of hair and possibly blood from the broken window and damaged door frame.  The following synopsis is based on a phone interview conducted with Bolton.On 07/02/18 at approximately 0048 hours, Johnny Bolton was awakened by his friend yelling at him regarding a noise disturbance downstairs.  The friend told Bolton ""the bear is back.""  Bolton ran downstairs and grabbed an airhorn which was located at the bottom of the staircase.  Bolton recalls the lights were on downstairs, as well as a radio.  Bolton noticed the front door was slightly open, leading him to believe Orton was outside.  As Bolton walked towards the front door, he looked down a hallway to his left.  Bolton noted the hallway was dark and the bathroom door, located at the end of the hallway, was closed.  Bolton walked out the front door and yelled for Gerry to get back inside the cabin.  Bolton walked back into the cabin through the same door which he exited.  As he walked into the entryway, Bolton did not see a bear.  Bolton turned around to shut the door.  After Bolton shut the door, he turned around and saw a bear moving toward him.  Bolton activated the airhorn again.  At that time, the bear stopped, approximately four feet from Bolton.  The bear stood up on its hind legs.  Bolton recalled the bear was approximately six feet tall on its hind legs.  Bolton activated the airhorn again, and the bear growled and made a movement towards Bolton.  Bolton used his right leg to deliver a ""snap kick"" to the bear's chest, striking the bear near the sternum.  The bear grunted and took a step backwards.  The bear dropped to four legs then retreated towards the darkened hallway.Bolton took the bear's retreat as an opportunity to move to a safer location.  Bolton ran to the base of the staircase and met Orton.  As the bear's exit route was now clear, it ran out of the house.  Orton checked on the overall health of Bolton and found Bolton was bleeding from three scratches sustained to right leg.  Orton assisted Bolton with cleaning his leg with hydrogen peroxide and Neosporin antibiotic cream.  Bolton called 911 to report the bear incident and El Dorado Sheriff's Office arrived and took a report.On 07/04/18, Bolton sought medical attention at the request of his friend.  At the hospital, Bolton's wounds were cleaned and re-bandaged.  He was also prescribed amoxicillin, an antibiotic to combat any bacteria transferred from the bear.  Bolton noted the distance between the top scratch and bottom scratch was approximately 5.5 inches.  Bolton also noted the bear was a black bear in a blonde phase and stood approximately six feet tall on its hind legs.  Bolton believes the open layout of the neighborhood would pose as a challenge to any attempts to trap the bear.During the investigation on 07/05/18, I spoke with a neighbor, Dan Gilson (975 Emigrant Rd.) who informed me his cabin had been broken into multiple times over the previous two weeks.  Gilson also noted approximately five other residences in the neighborhood reported bear break-ins.The owner of the cabin Bolton was in is Earl 541-753-2850Johnny Bolton 323-253-8365Gerry Orton 530-541-3386 (number for the cabin)Dan Gilson 408-930-3114 or 530-541-2198","New","El Dorado",38.8961219,"-120.0550704"

One camper reported a cooler left outside was tipped, made noise and the bear ran away. The bear was rewarded at campsite #54. They left coolers and food under their picnic table and sounded their car alarm from their tent when they realized the bear was present. Both times the alarm was sounded, the bear climbed a tree. When quiet it returned to eat. A different camper said he checked his watch when he heard the car alarm. It was 1:00 am. I informed all campers present at the campground, and requested they keep their camp bear safe. I informed the hosts and Thousand Trails Managers.

When he finally did break free, I shot a 38 snub nose above his head and he didn't even bolt. Just looked at me and casually sauntered away.

Our neighbor's garbage container was being moved past our car and raided.  We share a common short drive.  The neighbors do not live here during the warm months but had visited over the weekend and we offered to move their container down to be emptied on Thursday Morning.  Their container had been located next to their house and under their car port.  We turned on the outside lights and looked out the bedroom window.  We could clearly see two black bears (brown in color) one a sow (estimate 100-150 lbs.) and one a cub (estimate 75 lbs.).  Their were dragging plastic garbage bags out of the garbage container and strewing the contents all over the common drive.  I hit the panic button on our van and the noise chased the bears away.  All this activity within a few feet of our mobile home.  We no longer feel secure in out home.  We worry that should we be out at a Church Function at night and come home we would find bears between our car and the entrance doot.  We feel trapped.  Do not explain to us that the bears were here before us.  The sow looked to be about three years old.  This retirement communitiy has been here since the fifties.  All the native bears that lived here before the gold rush were eated for bear stew during the gold rush as this area was inhabited since then.  These current bears have gadually taken up territory in this inhabited area from other non-inhabited areas over the intervening years.  Our dog is still frightened and smart.

He was contacted by anglers advising a younger blonde color bear had been walking the shoreline taking people's trout that they had caught.  Lt Dailey searched the area and was unable to locate the bear.On 05/11/18 at approximately 1530 hours Lt Dailey was waved down by a group of anglers at Hwy 395 and Benton Crossing Road in Mono County.  The anglers said they had been fishing at Convict Lake and had caught some trout.  In the boat launch parking area the anglers placed the fish on their truck's tailgate.  After they removed the fish a small blonde / brown bear approached and climbed into the bed of their truck.  Another truck honked it's horn causing the bear to run off down Convict Creek towards the campground.  The group also advised the bear had taken a child's backpack that was on the shoreline earlier that day.  Lt. Dailey responded attempting to locate and haze the bear without success.  While at Convict Lake Lt. Dailey was approached by several people who all said they had seen the bear.  They said the bear is young and still afraid of people.  One person attempted to take photos but the bear ran off.Lt. Dailey contacted Wildlife Management and referred the bear to them.  Sacramento requested posting of the area and attempted hazing.On 05/11/2018, I was instructed to patrol through the Convict Lake area for a nuisance bear and attempt to haze it with beanbag rounds. The bear had been seen in the area walking the shoreline of Convict Lake and taking stringers of trout from the anglers. The bear had also been seen meandering around the Convict Lake Resort.  I stopped in and spoke with Buddy, the manager of lodging at Convict Lake Resort. Buddy informed me that the bear had been lingering around the resort for several weeks now and that he even climbed on top of an SUV to take a nap. Buddy informed me that some guest had been feeding the bear.   Upon contact with the Convict Lake campground host, they informed me that the bear has been in the area for several weeks and has not caused damage yet but has been snooping around vehicles and camp sites.  I drove the shore line of the lake with no reports from citizens seeing the bear. I drove into the campground and observed a large group of people huddled together and looking back at another campsite. I responded to their location and observed a small bear, approximately 100-150 lbs, with a golden brown hair color. The bear was not overtly afraid of me. I utilized my department issued shotgun and fired two rubber less lethal rounds at the bear. Due to my proximity i ricocheted the rounds into the bear. The bear ran approximately 15 yards a pine tree and began climbing the tree. I fired two OC Rocket, less lethal rounds at the tree in an attempt to keep the bear out of the tree. I instructed the crowd to go back to their campsite and to keep a low volume. I informed them that if the bear does not see them or hear them, he will come out of the tree and I can continue hazing him from the campground.  After waiting approximately ten minuets, the bear came down from the tree and meandered across the roadway. I again utilized my department issued shotgun and fired a single less lethal animal beanbag round at the bear. I was approximately 10 yards away. The round hit the bear in the left hindquarter. At this point in time the bear ran south across a field, through and empty camp site and up along the hill to the south of the campground. I pursued the bear on foot until I could no longer see the animal.","Active","Mono",37.5947415,"-118.848637"

On at least one occasion, the bear crawled into an open car window and retrieved a lunch box. No damage to the vehicle was reported. No threatening or public safety issues reported. I also advised the owner that in the event of an emergency or public safety situation he should call 911 and myself.

"WIR-2018-001160","5/15/2018 0:00","Black Bear","Potential Human Conflict","A large black bear was laying on my backyard grass around 4pm (yard is fully-fenced with concrete walls and gates).  The kids were about to jump in the pool, but quietly came back inside (50 ft distance to bear); the bear looked at us through the glass but did not seem concerned.  It got up and wandered over to the side of the house where the trash is.  It made a meager attempt to pop the lid open with its snout, but decided mostly to just stand there.  This is just a standard black trash container that did have food waste and was easily accessible, though the bear ultimately did not eat anything on our property.  The bear casually walked toward the pool, but instead of diving in the warm water it carefully navigated our waterfall, walked along the pool edge, and turned toward our back fence, which it then easily climbed over.  While its behavior was not aggressive, we also were very careful to stay inside, so it was a peaceful backyard, no threat of a dog, etc.  We are in a densely populated area with many kids and our neighbors have dogs.  I called the Sheriff who said they contacted Wildlife, but nobody contacted me.  I do not want to harm the bear, but we spend every day outside in our fenced backyard and with a bear occupying the same small enclosed space the risk of conflict is very high.  The bear seems acclimated to people, glanced at my neighbor whom came outside right as the bear climbed the fence, but was generally not concerned that people were nearby.  I have pictures and video, and the Sheriff came to the house about an hour after I called.  I would like to know how the bears are tracked by the ear tags (assuming RFID)?","Closed","Los Angeles",34.3717322,"-118.5928564"

I met him at his residence - 1830 Tepusquet Rd, Santa Maria - the following morning to do a site visit. The property is a 120 acre ranch in suitable black bear habitat near Los Padres National Forest. The house, a detached garage, an RV trailer, and a chicken coop are enclosed by a 5-foot no-climb/barbed wire fence. He explained that while he and his wife were away on 4/15/18 around 0900 hours, his home video surveillance camera caught a black bear on his front porch. I saw the videos, which showed an black bear with a right ear tag standing up and looking into the kitchen through a window. A video clip also showed the bear rummaging through food taken from an unsecured outdoor refrigerator. After Andy and his wife returned, around 1930 hours, he found the bear turning over a trashcan filled with dog food adjacent to a chicken coop near the residence. Andy fired a shotgun into the hillside to scare the bear away with sound. The bear ran up into a tree and remained there for some time, but had left by 2200 hours. The following morning, on 04/16/18 at 0900 hours, Andy found that the bear had knocked over 2 metal trash cans with unsecured lids containing chicken feed and grain outside the chicken coop. He also found that the bear had entered the chicken coop by crushing down some chicken wire fence. Inside the coop, the bear had knocked over 2 additional metal trash cans with chicken feed and had torn a plastic sheet that sheltered the chicken house as if it was trying to reach the chickens. The bear had also knocked over a metal trash can near the house containing household garbage. At 2030 hours, Andy saw the same bear near his house, and scared the bear up another tree. The bear eventually fled down the hill away from the house. On 04/17/18, around 0730 hours, Andy's wife saw the same bear on their front porch eating more food out of the outdoor refrigerator. The bear ate some peanut butter, string cheese, and some packets containing an expensive powder-based medication that Andy takes. The bear was gone by the time I arrived at 0900. I advised Andy to secure all of the trash cans containing scented foods, garbage, chicken feed etc in a separate and protected area (ie. a detached garage) so that the bear will learn there is no food to be found. The outdoor refrigerator is solar-powered and cannot be moved indoors, so I advised him to secure the door with a chain or strap so the bear could not enter. I suggested that to protect his chickens, he could try fortifying the chicken coop with stronger fencing and/or electric fencing. I also suggested motion-activated lights and noise makers to haze the bear. We identified weak points in the fence that surrounds the house where the bear is likely entering. Andy did not request a depredation permit, but he was aware of them. I explained the circumstances that must exist for an encounter depredation event.

I contacted Mono County Sheriff’s Office dispatch who provided me with the reporting party’s information.  At 2140 hours I contacted Mr. Jim Posthumus by cell phone.  He reported a bear had broken into his vacation home located at 102 Rea Drive, June Lake CA.  He said one of his neighbors called an left him a message advising him of the situation. Mr. Posthumus stated he believed the bear had broken into his house around 1500 to 1600 hours that same day.  However no one was currently staying at the residence.  Mr. Posthumus stated his cabin was full of food and sugary foods. He requested a response to check on his house since he lived down south.Mr. Rea said he was not sure if the bear was still in his house or if there was even damage.  He attempted to contact his neighbors by phone without success.  He wanted a depredation permit if there was damage and requested our Department kill the bear.  I explained the depredation permit process and explained he would be responsible to higher some one who could legally take the bear.I advised Mr. Posthumus that I would respond in the morning.  At 0915 hours I arrived at 102 Rea Drive, June Lake.  I observed a electric mat infront of the front door.  I walked along the deck to the rear of the cabin and observed broken glass on the wood deck from a window adjacent to the rear door.  The glass was very thin pane.  I observed two bear paw prints on the glass of the screen door.  There was also food containers on the deck and on the neighboring ground that had large canine teeth punctures.  I observed three frozen piles of bear scat on the deck near the broken window.  The broken window had been boarded up with a very thin board.There are multiple cabins with in 25 yards of Mr. Posthumus’ cabin and many more within 150 yards.

Its been destroying the trash cans once or twice a week for three years, and at this point I don't even care about that anymore. I've tried freezing the trash, spraying the cans with various repellents, etc, all that. The real problem is that it is now so acclimated that it has begun going after our chickens. We have had two incidents, one about a month ago and the last just the other night, where it has pushed through a fence (ripping it out of the ground and off a wall) to get into our yard and has carried off a total of 3 chickens. I tried electric fencing, I tried the fake predator eyes lighting system, nothing has worked. It is so unpredictable in its timing that I am concerned about letting my three kids out to play. It has been out at 1230 in the afternoon, 6 in the evening, 7 in the morning, basically whenever. I know its not a stalking animal like a mountain lion, but if my 2 or 6 year old comes running around a corner at 2 in the afternoon and runs into it that's going to be a real problem.

At 4:30 am the bear was on the front porch. The dog was also outside on the porch.  A screened window in the kitchen/dining room was open approximately 8 inches & the bear broke through the screen. My husband startled the bear off the front porch (access to the screen).  At 4:45 am the same bear then went around to the back of the house and was attempting to negotiate the back door. We startled the bear away from the door, but the bear only ran approximately 10 feet and stayed. We opened the door making loud noises to encourage departure. The bear did not seem interested in leaving. With more loud noises, the bear begrudgingly moved out of the outside lighted area.  The bear does not appear to be frightened by human contact.The black bear appears to be young, maybe 1 or 2 years old.  Approximately 125 pounds (based on the size of our dog). The bear was thin in comparison to pictures of similar size bears. Approximately 1 month ago, a large bear put a paw & nose print on my vehicle during the night. We believe this bear encounter -today- to be a cub of the larger bear.  I was told of a large black bear animal attack approximately 3 miles from our home in which the bear did not survive. This young bear may be possibly an orphan as a result. Is it possible to engage with your department to arrange a live trap and relocate this bear? We believe the bear will return- based on the behavior this morning. We do have a gun for protection but would prefer to preserve life and have the animal relocated.","Closed","Mendocino",39.6524052,"-123.4747936"

It has ripped the doors and windows off 3 of my friends houses and went in and has caused considerable damage. this bear has also broken into our mobile home and tried to get into our cabin. Luckily no one was in the mobile when it broke in. The bear has chased people down the street when they tried to get it away from their yard or trash dumpster. it also chased a young man on a bicycle for a short distance a couple of days ago. It is very aggressive and in broad daylight.  If it tries to break in again I am going to shoot it!! and hopefully kill it but I'm not a great hunter, but I'm also not going to allow it to come into my house or hurt anyone.

About a half a mile before the sign for Boulder lake. I was standing about 20 yard off the main trail trying to hunt dear. I had seen fresh deer tracks and what I thought was fresh mountain lion track. This overlooks a meadow with a lot of deer bedding area right next to the river. I felt uneasy and never heard anything but turned around and about 20 feet from me a Black bear was coming at me from behind me. He was stalking me like a cat about ready to pounce on something. As soon as I turned around he charged me. I did not have time to do anything except aim and shoot. I do have a bear tag but was not hunting bear at all. I was deer hunting. The bear was facing me directly and his head was down as he was charging I did not have anytime to say hay bear or do anything else as he was charging fast. I hit the bear in between the head and shoulder. He spun around and took off running into the thick Manzanita and tall think brush into the steep mountain face. This was around 5:30 pm. We found little blood at first but as we tried to make our way through the 6 foot tail very thing brush and uneven ground on the side of the slope, we could only get so far. at some points the ground was very uneven and we even tried to walk on top of the brush but it was steep and impenetrable. I even feel backwards and tumbled downhill with my rifle flying out of my hands.  We tried to recover the Bear until sunset and it started getting dark. I feel so bad as we were not able to recover the bear. I was able to get another shot in the bear but he still kept going where we just could not fallow him. We did not get back to the truck until around 9pm. I tried to go to the Summit ranger station and report it but they were closed. I did not know what to do. I did Sacramento DFG and they gave me Fresno's ranger district phone number. I left a voicemail and a Margarita Hernandez gave me call back. her number is (559)243-4005 X151.

It has has continued to eat my wine grapes which have not yet been harvested.  He has concentrated his dining to an area adjacent to a 2 acre section of undeveloped acreage (within the 10 acres).  Fresh scat appears daily within the vineyard and there is continued evidence of it stripping the grape clusters off the vines each morning.  I believe that it is bedded down during the day in the undeveloped 2 acres that I previously mentioned.  There are also signs of heavy game trails leading into this area.The area where he has been eating is concentrated to approximately 1 acre of unharvested grapes witch contained approximately 7 tons of grapes valued at $1,600.00 per ton. These grapes are sold to another winery and I estimate that they will not be harvested until October 14th at the earliest. I estimate that he has already consumed 1-2 tons since November 30th.

The attacks started with our chicken and trash, and since the bear has killed our entire flock of six chickens, it continues to terrorize our trash multiple times a week and frequent our property. I attempted to reenforce the chicken coop(when we still had chickens), but my efforts were no match for the strength of this determined bear which ripped my coop appart to get to my chickens. The bear that I estimate to be 150-250 pounds continues to attack my trash cans multiple times a week at various times of the day, however typically attacks at night. Also I notice that my neighbors have been victims to this bear as I see trash scattered up and down the road every week on trash day. I have witnessed the bear deficating in my yard as if to mark its territory and it has shown by its slow retreat to my presence that it is defiant to humans. I have tried various deterents to discourage this behavior such as motion sensor sprinkler systems and loud noises but they have had little effect. I fear that due to this bear's defiance to humans that a confrontation is possible. Recently I have seen multiple reports on the local news station about others in the area that have had similar problems with a bear matching this bear's description. I have not observed a tag on this bear.","Closed","Butte",39.8641663,"-121.5711372"

Several free range chickens also roost on the fence as well as on the rabbit cages at night .Over the past several weeks a black bear has entered the fenced area on several occasions by pushing down a portion of the fence near the back of the house. Most recently (Aug 28) I was awakened by the dog barking to see a bear exiting the fenced area with a chicken in its mouth. Next morning I walked out into the wooded area behind the house and saw bear droppings and chicken feathers in two separate spots, concluding that  a bear had been in the fenced area at least twice previously, killing chickens and taking them out back to consume. The next night I was again awakened by the dog barking, got up, went outside, and observed a bear going for a chicken on an empty cage in the middle of the pen. After distracting it from that chicken as well as two others I managed to get it to leave.The bear appeared to be not very afraid of humans. The next day, I called Warden James Smith to get a depredation permit, got his voicemail, and left a message advising him of the situation. The next evening at about 11 pm the dog was barking again, so I went outside and saw the dog barking ,not at the fenced area, but toward the area between the end of the house and the workshop 15ft away where I observed a black bear. Approximately 1 1/2 yr ago Warden Smith had issued a depredation permit to me for a bear problem not involving loss of animals- just loss of feed and property damage. Feeling that this was a more serious problem, I shot the bear. I took the shot at a downward angle in a direction away from the neighbor's house. After initially dropping to the ground, the bear made its way back into the brush. I later learned that the bear had made its way onto the neighbor's property and under a pile of logs a very short distance away, where it died.","Closed","Trinity",40.5146944,"-123.1804642"

On 8/23/17 Garrison reported he found claw marks on his window of his trailer of a mountain lion attempting to break into his trailer. I conducted a site visit and confirmed Garrison had claw marks on his window approximately 5 feet off the ground. There were a total of 5 pronounced claws marks and multiple partial claw prints. The pronounced claws, size and five of them appeared to be of a bear and not a mountain lion. I attempted to locate tracks but due to hay and disturbance from Garrison's dog I was unable. The claws appeared to be fresh within the past week but not from the previous night due to the settling of dust. Garrison had dog food, trash and water around his trailer none of which had been disturbed. I informed Garrison while it was not normal for a bear to walk in an look into a window it was possible it got scared off from the dog.On 8/24/17 Garrison contacted me again to express his disagreement with my conclusion. Garrison stated he agreed the marks were not of a mountain lion but did not think they were of a bear either. Garrison said the marks looked like talons and felt another creature could have left them. Garrison could not explain what the other creature could be. I explained to Garrison I could not issued a depredation permit for the take of any animal until more evidence of damage or safety could be established.

"WIR-2017-003357","8/6/2017 0:00","Black Bear","General Nuisance","On 08/06/17 at 1417 hours, I received a call from SURCOM dispatch that the residents of 750 Tepusquet Rd had a bear in their outdoor doghouse. I called the RPs and spoke with Anita Lange who lives with her husband Gary Lange at 750 Tepusquet Rd. Anita told me that upon returning from church earlier in the afternoon, she discovered that the lids on their galvanized steel trashcans containing dog food had been removed. The trashcans were located on their front porch adjacent to a doghouse. Anita looked into the doghouse and was surprised to find a black bear occupying the space. Anita stated that the bear did not seem react to human presence as expected and appeared lethargic. Anita stated that shortly after discovering the bear, it came out of the doghouse and wandered down the front steps of the porch into the yard. According to Gary, while in the yard, the bear vomited a small amount and then returned to occupy the same doghouse. Gary and Anita thought that the bear looked ""emaciated"" and noted that it was moving slowly. They were worried that the bear was unhealthy, and since it appeared content in the doghouse, Gary secured a chain link fence at the doghouse entrance to keep the bear contained. They could not see if the bear had any injuries. Anita called Zoo To You and Pacific Wildlife Care who referred her to CDFW. I asked Anita if the bear had damaged any property, and she said it had not. I asked if she and Gary were concerned for their safety, and she said they were not. I asked if they could determine the size of the bear, and Anita said that it was small, but not a very young cub. Anita had taken a photo of the bear in the doghouse, and she agreed to send the photo to my cell phone. It was very difficult to see, but I thought the bear might have been a small adult. I advised Anita that I would be responding to their location from Guadalupe and to leave the bear alone for the time being.  At 1432 hours, I sent a text message to Wildlife Management ES Christine Thompson with a summary of the situation. At 1434 hours, I sent the same text message to Lt. Jamie Dostal who quickly acknowledged. While en route to Tepusquet Rd, I encountered a disabled vehicle blocking the intersection of HW 101 and HW 166. One CHP officer was on scene, and he needed assistance with traffic control. I directed traffic for about 10 minutes until I could be relieved. I continued to Tepusquet Rd and called Christine Thompson at 1509 hours since she had called while I was directing traffic. I agreed to update Christine once I had evaluated the situation. I arrived at 750 Tepusquet Rd around 1530 hours and was greeted by Gary, Anita, their son-in-law, Nathan Schofield (805-937-3805), and their young grandchildren, Estelle and Trevor. The property is an 80-acre ranch almost entirely east of Tepusquet Rd consisting of oak woodland habitat, pasture, and a stream corridor. They have horses, cattle, and chickens on the property. A no-climb and barbed wire fence surrounds the house and a couple barns. The house’s front porch faces west and opens to a fenced yard with a small dog kennel along the south side. Gary showed me a red-colored dog house on the porch adjacent to the front door and stairs leading to the yard. A small chain link gate was blocking the entrance to the doghouse and was secured with rubber straps. I used my flashlight to peer inside the doghouse, and I saw the bear – a large cub or small sub-adult – laying on its side. The bear lifted its head to look at me, but made no effort to move beyond that. I came within six feet of the doghouse.  I did not see any visible injuries, but I could not determine whether it appeared unhealthy. I asked Gary if the bear had attempted to escape, and he said that it had not. I saw the two galvanized trashcans that contained dog food about 15 feet from the doghouse. I took four photos showing the front porch and the doghouse, a photo of fresh bear scat at the top of the porch steps, and a photo of apparent bear vomit in the yard below the porch.  Since the bear appeared content to be left in the doghouse, I called Christine using the Lange’s landline (there was no cell reception). Christine and I agreed that since I could not clearly see the bear to evaluate its condition, the best course of action was to attempt to scare the bear from the doghouse and give it an avenue of escape from the porch and yard. Nathan, Gary, and I created a path for the bear to travel down the porch steps and through an open gate at the west end of the yard. The open gate, about 50 feet away, would be visible to the bear as it descended the steps. We rotated the doghouse to face the steps, removed the chain link gate containing the bear, and then coaxed the bear out of the doghouse by making loud noises, pounding on the doghouse, and sending a stream of compressed air through the back of the doghouse. After about 10-20 seconds, the bear ran out of the doghouse, down the steps, and into the yard toward the open gate. A short distance from the open gate, however, the bear climbed about 25 feet up a tall oak tree in the yard along its path of escape. I took a video of the bear escaping the doghouse. I estimated that the bear was about 75-100 lbs and was probably a cub born the prior year. The bear moved normally and did not seem to be injured. It seemed to be a healthy weight and had a healthy-looking dark brown coat. The bear had a silver-colored metal ear tag in the right ear. I could not make out any writing or number on the tag. It appeared to be a female. I took three photos of the bear in the tree. It appeared to quickly find a comfortable position and fall asleep in the tree. I called Christine to update her on the events that had occurred and to seek her advice. She told me that she had been in contact with Captain Cindy Wood and that Warden Dennis Rosenburg was already on his way to provide assistance. I described the bear, and Christine recognized that it was likely the same female bear that had been picked up as an orphaned cub in July 2016 near Tepusquet Rd and HW 166. The cub was rehabilitated in northen California and was released by wildlife management with a silver-colored metal right ear tag in February 2017. It was released near Buckhorn Ridge in Los Padres National Forest a short distance to the east. Christine recommended that once Warden Rosenburg arrived, we work together to haze the bear with beanbag rounds to instill a fear of humans. We planned that if the bear came down the tree before Warden Rosenburg arrived, I would haze the bear myself and try to scare it away from the house. While waiting for the bear to come down the tree, I interviewed the family to get the complete account of their encounter. Nathan stated that the night prior, 08/05/17, around 1730 hours, he had seen the same bear while he was leaving the Lange residence with his wife and kids. As they were passing through the main gate along Tepusquet Rd, the Schofields saw the bear walking along the ground. Their dogs, which were in the vehicle, saw the bear and began barking which caused the bear to climb up an oak tree. Since the Lange’s have commercially raised honeybee boxes on the property north of the house, they returned to warn Gary and Anita of the bear’s presence. The bear was still on the property near Tepusquet Rd and was up a different tree when the Schofields finally left for the evening. Gary and Anita were unable to locate the bear upon searching for it themselves. They checked the bee boxes for bear damage and did not find any damage. Around 2000 hours on 08/05/17, Gary found that one of the galvanized steel trashcans containing dog food on the front porch had been pushed over, but no bear was seen. Around 2200 hours, Anita discovered fresh bear scat on the ground in their front yard, but no bear was seen. They kept their dogs inside during the evening. On 08/06/17, Gary and Anita left the house in the morning to attend church, and they returned home around 1300 hours. Around 1330 hours, Anita went onto the front porch to add bungie straps to the dog food trashcans. She found both trashcans upright, but both lids were unexpectedly removed. Anita then looked inside the doghouse to find the bear inside. It is possible that the bear slept inside the doghouse overnight. Minutes after Anita discovered the bear, it left the doghouse, walked into the yard where it vomited, then returned to the doghouse. I asked Anita and Gary if something frightened the bear to cause it to return to the doghouse, and they did not believe so. About 15-20 minutes after the bear returned to the doghouse, Gary blocked it in using the gate. At 1700 hours, while Warden Rosenburg was still on his way, the bear descended the tree. I had loaded my shotgun with five Accusox 12 gauge Bean Bag shells labeled “Animal Control Only (300 fps)” appropriate for hazing bears. At 1701 hours, when the bear had completely removed itself from the tree, I fired one beanbag round and hit the bear in the meaty portion of a rear leg. I yelled loudly at the bear, but it retreated up the same tree instead of fleeing toward the open gate that was only about 15 feet away. I called Christine to tell her what had happened, and we agreed that I should let her climb down the tree again and move further from the tree and house before hazing a second time. Around 1730 hours, the bear came down the tree again and wandered around the yard, but would not walk near the open gate. She did not appear to mind my presence if I remained quiet; she could see that I was standing on the porch about 20 feet from her, yet she ignored my presence and came about 5 feet from me as she explored the perimeter of the house. She even walked up the steps of the porch while I was standing on the porch within her field of view. She remained in the yard for approximately 30 minutes while we waited for her to approach the gate. She briefly retreated underneath the house, but Nathan scared her out by spraying her with a garden hose. She climbed up a different oak tree in the yard before returning to the original tree. The bear never showed aggression, but after a while began to show signs of stress while sitting in one of the oak trees (heavy breathing and occasionally jaw snapping). Warden Rosenburg arrived around 1745 hours. At 1805 hours, the bear again descended the tree nearest the open gate. Nathan sprayed the tree above her with a garden hose to discourage her from climbing up the same tree, and she fled through the gate and down the hill as we had planned. I fired two beanbag rounds and hit her one time center-mass. My second shot missed. Warden Rosenburg fired two beanbag rounds and hit her at least one time. The bear retreated up a tree about 25 yards downhill from the gate, and Warden Rosenburg fired a third beanbag round while she was in the tree. He did not know if his third shot hit her or not. She climbed down the tree and fled another 25 yards to climb up another tree. We yelled loudly to scare her while hazing with the beanbags. I recovered my three beanbags and photographed them. Warden Rosenburg could not recover his beanbags. We picked up our expended shells and then returned to the house to follow up with the Langes. I gave Anita my business card and asked her to call me if they have future problems with this bear. I explained to Anita and Gary that we had employed a painful but humane negative reinforcement technique that will hopefully teach the bear to avoid humans. I advised them to use loud noises to scare her away if she returns. They said they would look into purchasing an airhorn and consider shooting a firearm safely into the ground as a scare tactic. I spoke with Nathan and suggested implementing exclusion such as electric fencing. Nathan stated that they had used electric fencing in the past and found that it worked well in winter when the ground was moist, but was ineffective during the dry summertime. The Lange’s were happy with the outcome, and they were very thankful for our help. Warden Rosenburg and I left the residence around 1830 hours.I called Christine at 1846 when I came into cell reception to update her on what had happened and she approved of our efforts. I also told Christine about an apparently unrelated conversation I had on 08/04/17 with Susan at 175 Tepusquet Rd (805-937-9540) who simply had a bear sighting on her property on 08/03/17. Susan said that the bear did not quickly run to flee when humans were present. She did not know if the bear was injured. Susan had said the bear had a very light brown coat (the young bear at 750 Tepusquet Rd on 08/06/17 had a dark brown coat). She did not mention seeing an ear tag. Susan reported that there was no property damage or perceived safety threat. She had Pygmy goats on the property and was not sure if she should be concerned. Apparently, local outdoor cats have disappeared in recent weeks. I discussed exclusion, reducing attractants, the helpfullness of barking dogs, automatic lights, and electric fencing with Susan.  I called Lt. Jamie Dostal at 1856 hours and summarized the events of the day. I sent Christine Susan’s contact info by email at 2036 hours on 08/06/17 so that she could follow up and determine if the reported bear was the same bear encountered at the Lange property.","Closed","Santa Barbara",34.9921749,"-120.1931681"

The bear then approached a woman at her trailer within five feet.  The cub was walking behind the bear with an unsteady gait, as if sick or injured.  The bear swatted at the dirt aggressively toward the woman, while looking back at the cub.  The bear eventually left the area.

For the last several months we have been aware of a bear or bears on my property. The first incident was a bear getting into the garage and getting into the goat food and dragging a 50 # unopened sack of COB down the hill aways. The bear also came into the laundry room and ate our dogs food. We were home at the time, but I was taking a nap in my room with all three dogs locked in with me. They did not alert because of that. My daughter heard the ruckus in the garage and the bear crunching the dog food, but had forgotten I was napping and thought I was making the noise in the garage and wondered how a dog could be chewing so loudly. Since that time the bear has been a regular visitor and the dogs are doing a good job chasing or treeing the bear(s). Twice I have walked out of the back door and the bear has been within 15' or closer. I live with my daughter and her two children, aged 9 and 10. We also have 4 goats on our property. Two days ago I came home from shopping and as soon as I opened the car door the dogs could smell the bear and leapt from the car and treed the bear at the back door. Today I came home and found that the bear had been in the laundry room inside our home and had dragged (and opened) the dog food canister out of the laundry room onto the deck. I like bears but I feel like the bear is getting too comfortable and I feel it may become a dangerous situation for my family.

On 28-July-2017, I responded to the location and met the RP. The RP explained to me that a bear with two very small (still nursing) cubs have been seen throughout the campground the past week. Witnesses saw the bear rip a door open on one of the unoccupied cabins in an attempt to get food. I confirmed the damage to the cabin on the 28th. I explained the options that were available to the owner of the property. She decided to try deterrents to keep the bears away. The RP placed bleach, ammonia, and peppermint oil soaked rags throughout the camp. RP also turned on radios, used more motion lights, and used an electronic fence in certain areas. All these deterrents were utilized starting the night of 28th. On 30-July-2017 at approximately 1600 hrs., I received a call from the same RP. She explained to me that a bear had entered her main house and caused damage to the exterior and interior of the house. She said the bear had to have entered her house between 1200-1500 hours that day (30-July).  The RP told me that she was/is very scared due to that being her house and having two children that live there with her. NOTE: Nobody was home when the bear entered the house. On 30-July-2017 Warden T. Norris and I responded back to the RPs house. She said that she left her house around noon and came back at 1500 hrs., and realized a bear had been in her home. I confirmed that the bear entered through a slightly open bedroom window. The bear removed the window screen causing damage to it and the window frame/sill. Once inside, the bear ate some food and knocked numerous items off the wall causing damage. It appeared the bear then left through the same window it entered. Multiple footprints and teeth/claw marks were observed throughout the house. The RP also advised me that on 29-July numerous campers reported seeing the bear and cubs frequenting the camping areas in the middle of the day. Employees attempted to haze the bear by using air horns and banging pots and pans together. They told me that it did not faze the bear at all. The bear stayed in place and made “huffing and puffing” noises at the employees. The bear and cubs meandered around and eventually left the area.

After looking around the vehicle and taking pictures I really believe it was a Bear Attack and the he/she was cover with glass and shook it off. I had big dirty paw prints and drool all over the drivers side.

"WIR-2017-003138","7/15/2017 0:00","Black Bear","Depredation","I had filled this out a couple of days ago but don't know whether or not that it was transmitted.  Over the last several years we have had on-again/ off-again problems with bears getting into our garbage.  Most of those incidents were solved by buying our bear-proof garbage can.  The bears have managed to punch a few holes into that new garbage can, but that nuisance level we could tolerate just fine.There has been a significant and sudden escalation of the bear problem in the last week.  The first was last week when the bear ripped off the ""doggie door"" that lets our dog into and out of the mud room (where the dog  food is kept).  Once the bear had removed that doggie door, he (or she) could not fit through the opening left so did not ever get into the house by that effort.  A couple of days later, the bear broke through the screen door to our 23-foot RV and entered to reach the refrigerator/freezer.  The freezer door was torn off to access the food in the freezer.  Only the freezer door was destroyed and needed to be replaced.  The very next day the bear returned.  The bottom one-third of the main entry door was ""peeled"" off, but that opening was once again not large enough for the bear to get inside the RV.  So the only damage was destruction of the door.  According to the repairman from Demartini RV Service, the door, door jamb, and the screen door all have to be replaced..  Those parts have already been ordered.The scary part of all this history is that it is not as if we have had bad habits that have ""created"" this bear misbehavior.  For many years we have coexisted with the black bear population.  We have done nothing different recently.  The only behavior that has changed has been that of the bear(s).  We have a 5 and 7 year old grandkids who live next door who live next door.  Even though most of the bear activity happens during night time hours, eventually -- it would make sense -- there will be a face-to-face confrontation with a bear.  Respectively,Barry A. Turner, DMDAfter-thought: Before dental school, my original degree was in Fish and Game Management, so I do have some appreciation of the complexity of human/ wild animal interactions.  My understanding is that black bears do tolerate relocation reasonably well compared to other large animals (mountain lions).  My family and I would much prefer relocation of the bear.

Most likely this is the same bear that we have been seeing for a couple of years, and there has never been a problem other than tipped over garbage cans.  That problem was solved by using a ""bear proof"" can. For no obvious reason, the threatening bear behavior has escalated to the point of property damage and forceful entry into our RV and attempted entry into our house (ripped out the ""doggie door"")..  That happened five days ago.  Three days later, the bear opened the latched screen door and entered our 23-foot RV and tore off the freezer door and removed all the food from the freezer and one of the food cabinets.  One day later (today) the bear, with the RV door closed, latched, and locked, grabbed the bottom edge of the main entry door and peeled the bottom third of the door back to expose the bottom 1/3, but the bear was too large to get through the opening.  I visited the Nevada City Sheriff's Department today, and they suggested that I start with contacting you.  The Economy Pest people had also suggested that I contact you.  It was mentioned that any sort of special permit to shoot the bear would need to come from the Fish and Game Department..  We would like to find some other answer, but we are taking into consideration that we have two young grandchildren (5 & 7) who live next door and have a dog that is no match for a bear.What are our options?  By the way, I am a retired dentist, but my first degree was in Fish and Game Management, so I understand the whole concepts involving wild animals and humans coexisting.  I really was anticipating that the bear would continue to be a ""nuisance"" -- which we could have handled just fine.  But we are doing nothing different to encourage these new bear behaviors.

The Bear entered through a partially open bathroom window breaking the screen and the blinds.  The bear opened the refrigerator and ate food from the refrigerator.  The bear also broke into the pantry and ate food from the pantry.  This bear had previously attempted to break into one of our kitchen windows in the mid-afternoon about a week earlier, but has been driven off by workers.   As we opened the front door, the bear came down the stairs from inside the house and was startled to see us (as were we him).  We yelled at the bear and backed out of the house leaving the door open for the bear to exit. We called the Placer County Sheriff's via 911 and they arrived shortly after and cleared the house. The bear apparently left by the same window it entered. This bear has been around our home many times and other homes in our neighborhood.  We believe that it is accustomed to humans and will attempt to break in again if given the chance.  We have placed motion detectors with barking dog sounds in the house, but fear for our well being with this bear in our neighborhood.  The bear is a mature male that we estimate about 250 to 300 pounds and appears to know how to make entries to homes and how to access food in homes.  We believe that the bear should be tagged and relocated.  We did not observe an ear tag on the bear.Thank you for your help.Jim Wulfsberg","Closed","Placer",39.2041953,"-120.2095638"

When I had to have the slider replaced the new slider temporarily did not have a lock and the bear came into the house one night when I was briefly not home and ripped off one of my cabinet doors and stole food etc. I called the Bear League and they temporarily lent me an electric mat which the bear did step on and it scared it away briefly, however then the bear resorted to breaking into my cars. It has done significant damage to one of my vehicles - ripped off the sideview mirror, tore up a head rest and some of the interior fabric and last night pulled off/cracked my rear bumper. My dog has woken me up on numerous occasions when the bear has been attempting to get into my property and i have gone out and yelled at it, banged pans together, and it is not scared at all. Last night when it was damaging my car I went out and yelled at it and it stood up on it's hind quarters and huffed and lunged. It did not go away until i threw things at it. I work for Clif Bar and it successfully got some bars out of the shed to begin with (unfortunately left by a coworker unbeknownst to me) and now keeps returning to try and get more.

A window was torn out of the wall and part of the wall was destroyed. The bear entered the cabin by climbing over the kitchen sink, and emptied the cabinets onto the floor, breaking dishes, jars bottles.... pulling down books from shelves, and generally ransacking the place. Apparently, the bear was followed by a group of raccoons, who were more meticulous in their destructive tendencies, pulling down more books, and so forth. In August of 2013 a bear broke into an outside storage room and found some honey and canned foods there. This storage area also had dishes stored and some old windows, which were all smashed. Together, I had about four wheelbarrows full of broken glass and dishes. Some years ago, a bear got through my electric fence and destroyed 25 bee hives. I gave up bee keeping due to this damage, as I could not think of a way to protect the bee hives.I did not observe the attack. However, I was on site June 8, 2017 through June 21, 2017, to make repairs and clean up the mess, and in one week I observed four bears approaching the cabin. The first was on Friday, June 9, 2017, and this was a large black bear that appeared to be in it's prime, with long fur that had brown highlights. I made a noise and he ran up the hill. On Saturday, June 17, I saw three more bears. The first in the morning, apparently an old bear, with gray patches of fur, walking toward the cabin on the driveway. at about 30 yards, he stopped, decided I was present, and turned and went down the hill. About three hours later, a bear the color of cinnamon appeared to be following the old bear. Then in the evening, I heard thumping on my wall and found a very young bear, perhaps a yearling - he did not know enough to be afraid of me, but by yelling and firing a gun to make a loud noise I was able to frighten him off. I had no idea that there were so many bears in the area. Beside the destruction of my bee hives, this is the first serious damage that they have done. I repaired my wall and put in another window, but am very worried about my cabin.","Closed","Humboldt",40.2161821,"-123.9616327"

Dishion #490) received a call from Surcom Dispatch of a bear that had broke into a cabin in the June Lake area in Mono County.  I was asked to call the Mono Sheriff Department for further information.  Mono S.O. gave me a RP name of Bob Marks, who was a neighbor of the property that was broken into.  I called Bob Marks and he told me the cabin is owned by two brothers, Chuck and Joe Larkin.  Marks told me he believed a bear had broken into the cabin at 655 Paiute Road on the night of 05-19-17.  Marks told me he had informed the owners of the cabin and they were coming to the cabin from the Los Angeles area.  Marks told me the owners had asked him to board up the broken windows with plywood, which he did.  On 05-20-17, at approximately 0930 HRS, Chuck Larkin called me and explained to me what had happened to his cabin.  I told Larkin, I would driver to the cabin and look at the damage.  At approximately 1215 HRS, I arrived at 655 Paiute Road in June Lake in Mono County.  I contacted the two brothers, Chuck and Joe Larkin, owners of the cabin.  They brought me in their cabin and I found three windows broken and trash bags with food and food containers that had been picked up by the Larkins that appeared to have been torn apart by a bear.  The cabin had been almost completely cleaned up by the time I arrived.  I found three windows and window frames that had been broken.  Larkin told me their refrigerator had the doors opened and food taken out of it.  The bear had gotten into the cabinets and taken food out of those also.  I found paw marks consistent to a bear on the east side of the house below the window.  There was also fresh bear feces on the wood patio on the north side of the cabin.I asked both brothers, Joe and Chuck Larkin, if they wanted a depredation permit for the damage done by the bear and they  told me they did not want a permit.  I explained to the Larkin brothers they could look into putting up an electric barrier around the house.  The Larkin brothers seemed very interested in this option and told me they were going to look into it.","New","Mono",37.7637689,"-119.1019109"

He stated that he had received a message from Vicky Kraft (Los Padres Bear Aware) that stated there was a ""bear emergency"" and that she did not have cell services.  I attempted to confirm what type of ""bear emergency"" this was and how to appropriately respond.  At 0709 hours Kraft sent me an email stating that she had no cell service and that an elderly lady, Karen Butler, had been swiped on her arm by a bear when she tried to haze the bear out of her house at 1424 Bernina Drive, Pine Mountain Club.  She continued that the two lacerations sustained by Butler were approximately 2.5 inches by .5 inches wide, and that she was headed down to Kaiser to seek medical treatment.  I emailed Kraft and let her know that we were responding.  Shortly after Kraft was able to borrow a phone and call.  She gave the phone number for Butler's neighbor, Toni Scafidi who was driving Butler to urgent care.  I directed Warden Craig to go to the location of the bear attack, and Warden Willis to go to make contact with Scafidi, determine which urgent care they were going to and to interview Butler and collect evidence.  See attached report from Willis.  USFS LEO St Clair stated he was available to help if necessary. I had him go to the Butler address and see if the bear was still at the address and keep it under observation.  I advised Captain Stevenson of the situation and gave him the contact information for the local USDA trapper and asked that he contact them to ask them to respond with a bear trap for assistance. At approximately 0930 hours I arrived at the Butler residence.  Warden Craig and USFS St Clair had been unable to locate the bear.  Kraft was also at the residence.  I asked Kraft to tell me what had happened that morning.  Kraft stated that around 0445 hours she received a call from PMC Patrol Nick about a bear in a residence at that Bernina address.  She responded to assist.  When she arrived at 1424 Bernina Drive a cinnamon colored bear sow and three cubs were at the address.  Kraft stated that multiple attempts were made to haze the bear out of the area but were unsuccessful.  They attempted making loud noises, using vehicle horns, an air horn, and reviving vehicle engines.  None of these methods were successful.  Kraft was able to get a strobe light and was finally able to haze the bear from the area.  At this time Kraft noticed that Butler had the lacerations on her arm and urged her to seek medical attention.  Kraft stated that this sow and cubs had been causing many problems in the local community, tearing down garage doors, and entering other residences.  Kraft also stated that she believed the sow was responsible for 3 dog deaths in 2015.  I asked Kraft if the information was shared with DFW and she stated that Biologist Vicky Monroe was aware of the incidents. After getting the information from Kraft I walked around the residence at 1424 Bernina.  There were quite a few trash items that appeared to have been scavenged by a bear.  I collected those items, including a Little Debbie Snack box that had a blood smear on it. At the back of the residence there is a patio that is fenced in by approximately 7 foot wooden slats, over the top of the patio is a heavy mesh wiring.  A section of the fence had been repaired with plywood.  Later from inside of the residence I could see that 3 of the fence slats had been broken and were now covered by the plywood.  I could also see into the patio.  The patio contained a lot of trash and debris.  From the patio there is a door that enters the kitchen of the residence and that door contains a doggy door.  The doggy door was also now covered with plywood.  Approximately 20 yards to the south of the residence I could see an indentation in the dirt that would be consistent with an area that a bear could have been bedded down.  Also in that immediate area was more trash that had been scavenged, as well as 6 or 7 large occurrences of bear scat.  I collected the trash as well as some bear scat.  I confirmed with Kraft that all the plywood was placed this morning. I asked Warden Craig, USFS LEO St Clair, and Kraft if Butler had given permission for us to enter her residence.  Kraft stated that Butler was fairly adamant that she did not want anyone in her residence.  I contacted Warden Willis and asked that he seek permission from Butler for us to enter her residence and look for evidence that the bear was in there.  Willis contacted me shortly thereafter and stated that Butler had given verbal permission for us to enter.  I entered through an unlocked door on the south side of her residence.  The door opened immediately to a stair case going up, and a lower level room off to the left.  The room was entirely filled with miscellaneous personal possessions and clutter, with only a path to walk around.  I went up the stairs and opened the door to the living space.  That area was also filled with clutter, with only paths to walk to various parts of residence.  The condition I observed seemed to be consistent with hoarding.  I went into the kitchen.  The kitchen was in disarray, potentially caused by the bear, unlike other parts of the house where the stuff was in piles and stacks. The kitchen floor was covered in kitchen items, trash and food.  The counters and the sink were completely covered and stacked with food, kitchen items, and dishes.  I could see the doggy door that lead to the outside patio.  I examined the doggy door and could not locate any obvious signs of bear activity either fur or paw marks.  I swabbed the inside and outside of the doggy door and collected that as evidence.  The doggy door had recently had a piece of plywood drilled over it to prevent further entry.  In front of the doggy door was what appeared to be a thick piece of particle board that would be used to block off the door as well as a thicker piece of plywood.  Both of those items were collected as evidence for potential bear DNA.   At approximately 1030 hours USDA arrived with a culvert trap and stated that they would assist in any way that they could.  At approximately 1150 hours Warden Willis was able to gain permission from Butler to place the culvert trap in her driveway.  The trap was placed and baited with bacon.  Wardens were divided into two 12 hours shifts to have 24 hour coverage, and USDA stated they would have at least one person on scene with the trap. At approximately 2200 hours Warden Shaw and I started our shift to watch the bear trap.  At approximately 0145 hours the trap was sprung.  Inside the trap was a cinnamon colored female bear, with what appeared to be enlarged teats consistent with having cubs.  No cubs were located in the immediate area.  I began checking the area.  Approximately 40 yards away I found 3 cubs at the base of a tree.  As I approached the cubs they did not immediately run and barely began to climb the tree.  I was able to get to the base of the tree, and 2 of the 3 cubs could have easily been grabbed from the tree had I been wearing leather gloves.  The cubs only moved further up the tree when 2-3 others joined me at the base of the hill.  We turned off our lights and remained quiet and the cubs came lower down the tree.  We attempted to use a catch pole to snare the cubs but they stayed just out of reach.  At this point I made the decision to immobilize the cubs.  Warden Shaw was able to dart the three cubs successfully.  At approximately 0315 hours the 3 cubs were placed into a cage and the sow was in the culvert trap.  Warden Shaw and I transported the cubs, sow, and evidence that I had collected earlier that day to Fresno where Biologist Dan Fidler would take them to the Wildlife Investigations Lab, and the evidence to the Wildlife Forensic Lab. Various pictures of the outside of the residence, inside, and the injuries sustained by Ms. Butler were taken and saved. Supplemental Report From Warden Willis:On 05/15/2017 at approximately 0700 hours, I (Martin Willis #789) was notified by Lt. Andrew Halverson of a possible bear/human attack/conflict in the community of Pine Mountain Club, Kern County. Lt Halverson advised me the victim was being transported to Kaiser urgent care (3501 Stockdale Hwy, Bakersfield, CA 93309) and asked me to conduct an interview with Mrs. Bultler. At approximately 0815 hours, I made contact with Butler at Urgent Care.  Mrs. Karen Butler (Victim)1424 Bernina Dr, Pine Mountain Club Kern County California, 93222 DOB 04/18/1940(661) 242-2211 Mrs Butler's house is within the community of Pine Mountain Club, Kern County. Her house is built on a hillside with the front of the house facing west. The west facing house shows 3 stories and the east side of the house shows 2 stories. At the east side of the house, there is a fully fenced 10'x20' wood patio. This patio has a 7' to 8' vertical slat wooden fence surrounding it and is attached to the house. Within the patio area is a door with an installed ""doggie door."" This door leads directly into the home's kitchen. The kitchen is approximately 10'x10' in size and is located at the most eastern portion of the house.   On 05/14/2017 at approximately 2030 hours, Karen Butler heard a loud noise coming from within the kitchen area of the house. Karen was able to see into the kitchen and observed a bear had broken the ""doggie door"" and was attempting to crawl through. The ""doggie door"" is approximately 20"" X 20"" and was secured by vertical brackets that allow the doggie door to be opened and closed manually by sliding the 1/8"" board up and down. Butler was able to make loud noises by banging a pot and pan together. When she did this, the bear retreated from the house but remained on the eastern attached patio. Butler called Pine Mountain Club (PMC) Patrol (Home Owners Association security) and reported the incident. At approximately 2100 hours PMC patrol arrived to Butler's address. Nick (unknown last name) conducted a perimeter search of Butler's property and observed a bear and 3 cubs within 30 yards of Butler's home. Nick attempted to as haze the bear by making/using loud noises, lights and yelling. All of the bears show little to no fear of the hazing techniques and only retreated a few yards.Several times throughout the night the bears returned to Butler's house, entered into the kitchen, took food and exited. Butler called PMC patrol 4 times throughout the night. At approximately 0300 hours (05/15/17) Nick responded to Butler's call. When Nick attempted to haze the bears, the largest of the 4 bears charged him and chased him for a short distance. I called and spoke to Nick of PMC patrol and he stated ""the mother bear isn't afraid of anything.""Additional attempts were made to secure the house and prevent further incidences.  At approximately 0400 hrs (05/15/2017), the bear returned to Butler's house and entered through the broken doggie door. Mrs. Butler again attempted to scare the bear away by banging a pan against the wall and counter top. The bear was within 4-6 feet of Butler's location. The bear was standing on its hind legs and pulling food out of the overhead cupboards. The bear did not respond to Butler's attempts to scare it. Multiple attempts were made. While Butler was yelling and banging the pan, the bear turned and struck Butler on her left hand, wrist and lower forearm. Butler sustained 3 large lacerations. Butler retreated to another room and called PMC patrol and a neighbor for help. The bear continued to pull food out of the cupboards, exiting the house with food and returning an unknown number of times but Mrs. Butler stated it was ""several times after being injured."" At approximately 0500 hours, Toni Scafidi (1412 Bernina Dr. Pine Mountain Club) and Nick PMC patrol arrived to Butler's residence. The bears were still on the property and were scared off by the group. Tony Scafidi stated the bears were very hesitant to leave and did not respond to noise like other bears have in the past. Scafidi assisted Butler with securing the house, cleaning her wounds and transporting her to Kaiser Urgent Care.  Butler arrived at the Urgent Care facility at approximately 0815 hours. Dr. Ruth Schale was the attending physician. Mrs. Butler sustained 3 lacerations to her left hand, left wrist and left forearm. Each wound measured: hand 4.0cm x .6cm, wrist 2.2cm x 3.2cm, forearm 1.0cm x 1.4 cm. Combined her injuries required 23 sutures to close up the wounds. Dr. Schale used our Department's Carnivore attack kit to collect possible DNA from the wound area prior to any medical procedures. A bath robe Butler was wearing during the incident was later collectedas evidence. Several other areas of the house and property were also swabbed for DNA collection.  Toni Scafidi's vehicle was also broken into during the early morning. A bear broke a side rear window, entered and severely damaged the interior of the vehicle. It has not been confirmed if it was the same bear.   (Witness)Toni Scafidi  (805) 341-6841, (witness) Nick (PMC patrol) (661) 242-3857","New","Kern",34.8367462,"-119.1625384"

I then secured the trash inside the garage and he has been back scouting around a few more times (all in the evening hours).  Today, he returned in the day and was aggressively trying to get in to the garage without success.  He then came up on to our wrap around porch and was sniffing around the doors and windows.

I asked the neighbors who were out in their side yard with flashlights what was going on and they said they thought they saw a bear in my back yard. They know I have an emu and have interacted with him, so they would have known the difference. My emu was running, trying to hide, ramming things including the windows trying to get in my house. It took about 4 hours to get my emu calmed down enough so I could sleep for a little while. When I got up around 6:30 he was still mildly agitated but eventually ate some of his feed, drank a bit of water, I hosed him down, etc. A neighbor a block from me said they had a bear in their back yard last August, and it climbed a tree and tore a bunch of limbs down. Last night I called 911 because I thought they might be able to help me, but they gave me your number.

Dishion #490) was contacted by Environmental Scientist Jonathan Fusaro at the Bishop Fish and Wildlife Field Office.  Fusaro told me he had just received a report from a resident at June Lake in Mono County of a dead bear on Los Angeles Street.  Fusaro showed me pictures of the bear weighing approximately 300 lbs laying in a meadow behind a house on Los Angeles Street.  The RP, Venessa Arnold said she had found the bear at approximately 1000 HRS on this day.  She told Fusaro she did not see any bullet holes.  The bear had blood coming from the mouth and was thought to have been possibly hit by a vehicle.  Fusaro and Environmental Scientist Tim Taylor retrieved the bear from Los Angeles Street and preformed a necropsy on the bear.  At approximately 1630 HRS, Fusaro called me and told me he believed there was a bullet hole entering in front of the bears left rear leg and traveling through the bears lungs.  Fusaro told me he believed the bullet was lodged near the neck of the bear, but could not find the bullet.  I told Fusaro I would drive to his location and retrieve the bear.  At approximately 1745 HRS, I met with Fusaro and we looked at the bear.  I then had Fusaro take me to Los Angeles Street in June Lake to show me the location where he found the bear.  At approximately 1815 HRS, we arrived at 77 Los Angeles Street in June Lake in Mono County.  Fusaro brought me to the backyard and showed me where he had found the bear.  At this time, RP Venessa Arnold came to our location and explained to me what she had found.  She told me, on this day, at approximately 1000 HRS, she was walking her dog through the yard at 77 Los Angeles Street, which is unoccupied, and found the dead bear in the backyard.  Shen then called the Bishop Fish and Wildlife Office and reported what she had found.  I then told Fusaro I was going to talk to neighbors in the area and he could leave which he did.  I then contacted approximately four residents in the area and received some information.I proceeded to 37 Los Angeles Street at approximately 1900 HRS and contacted John Nagy.  Nagy's residence is two housed south and approximately 80 yards to the southeast of where the dead bear was found.  I identified myself as Warden Shane Dishion from the Department of Fish and Wildlife.  I asked Nagy if he knew anything about the bear in the area.  He told me he did.  I asked what he knew and he immediately told me he shot it.  I proceeded to have Nagy explain to me what had happened.  Nagy took me to the north side of his residence which had an outbuilding, shed, located approximately 15 feet north of his house.  The shed had the door torn apart with another board covering the hole from a bear previously tearing through the door.  Nagy explained to me, this was the fourth time the bear, which he believed to be the same bear, had gotten into the shed in the past two weeks.  The bear had been getting into his freezer and eating items out of the freezer.  Nagy told me on this day (05-04-17) at approximately 0502 HRS, he was awakened by noises coming from his shed outside of his office window, by the bear.  As the bear was trying to enter the shed again, Nagy used his Remington 1100 12 gauge S# N379083V and fired one shot of OO buck out of his office widow at the bear.  He believed he hit the bear just behind the bears right front leg.  The bear then left in a north direction.  I found tracks consistent of a bear leaving in a north direction.  I paced the distance of the shot from Nagy's office window to where he told me the bear was when he shot and estimated the distance at approximately 12 feet.  On 05-05-17, I called Nagy with some follow up questions.  I asked Nagy if he believed this was the same bear each time and he told me had not seen the bear this year, but did believe it was the bear from the year prior, when the shed was broken into.  I also asked if he planned on contacting Fish and Wildlife to report the incident and he told me did plan on calling.  He told me had gone back to bed after shooting the bear then woke up and went to work.  His wife had called him later that day and told him the biologist, Tim Taylor, which he and his wife personally know, had been there to look at the bear.  Nagy told me he believed the notification was taken care of due to the fact Fish and Wildlife had gone to the scene.","New","Mono",37.7649242,"-119.1087917"

He described the cubs as light colored with one darker than the other.  The cubs ran past him and down the walkway to his house.  McCay-Moran looked at the car and saw a larger light colored bear in the car.  He saw an even bigger black bear in the middle of the street.  The light colored adult came out of the car with a plastic bag of carrots in its mouth.  The bear dropped the carrots, and charged at McCay-Moran.  The bear lifted up and hit McCay-Moran in the chest, knocking him down to the ground. McCay-Moran stated he did not see the paws/claws but guessed the bear hit him with its shoulder or forearms.  McCay-Moran had light scrapes on his hands from where he caught his fall.  McCay-Moran immediately stood up and held his hands high above his head and yelled.

PCSO sent a deputy to investigate and transferred the call to CDFW.  At approximately 1000 hours, Warden Brandon Rose called the RP (Christian 530-412-0756) who stated he saw an approximate 150-200lb bear charge the owner of the house he was working on.  He called 911 from a ladder.  He stated PCSO was now on scene at a residence two houses down.  He stated the bear charged the deputy and the deputy shot it with a beanbag or rubber bullet from a close distance.  The bear was now laying immobile in the driveway of 8462 Dolly Varden Ave.  I was able to talk to the deputy on the RPs phone.  The deputy stated an approximate 120lb bear moved toward him in an aggressive manner.  The deputy waved his arms and shouted at the bear.  The bear continued toward him and the deputy shot the bear with a rubber bullet from a distance of approximately 5'.  I confirmed this through video the deputy had taken.  The rubber bullet impacted the bear's head and the bear dropped on the driveway.  The bear was immobile except for various limb movements and occasional groaning.  I advised the deputy I would be en route from my HQ in Plumas County.
I arrived at 8462 Dolly Varden Avenue at approximately 1200 hours.  I found 3 PCSO deputies, various Bear League members including Ann Bryant, several on-lookers, and the homeowner Mr. and Mrs. Rick Lopez.  I saw an approximate 80lb blond bear laying in the driveway that I estimated to be 1 1/2 years old.  The bear was not moving.  I confirmed my earlier conversation with the PCSO Deputy.  Mr. Lopez was very concerned about the emotional stability of his wife and urged me to wrap up the incident as quickly as possible.  The Bear League wanted to take immediate custody of the bear and transport it to a vet in South Lake Tahoe.  The 3 deputies shortly cleared the scene.
I contacted Sr. Environmental Scientist Canh Nguyen who walked me through a quick assessment of the bear.  I determined the bear was breathing with shallow respirations at a rate of approximately 3-4 seconds.  It was unresponsive to being poked.  Its eyes were closed and I could see no visible trauma.  We determined the best option was to have a biologist/scientist respond to pick the bear up and transport it to Rancho Cordova for evaluation.  I relayed this information to the parties involved, none of which were happy with that solution.
I remained on scene with the homeowners, various Bear League members, and the bear until Nguyen arrived at approximately 1700 hours.  The bear was immobile and unresponsive for the duration of that time.  The bear was loaded into a bear box with the assistance of Ann Bryant and Mr. Lopez.  The bear was then transported to Rancho Cordova.","Closed","Placer",39.2416142,"-120.0237554"

We have a photo of what we believe is the same bear on our motion sensor camera set up at a spring. We also see constant proof of his continued existence through tracks and scat. We own 400 acres.

We had a hungry bear around this weekend. We did not see or hear him, but he did damage our two gates. One he must have had the munchies because he obviously tried to eat it! as you can tell by the picture… our other gate just had the latch broken. We have had many bear sightings thru the years, but this is the first time that we had property damaged. There was hair all over the gate and surrounding area. We can’t tell if it came from the hills or from the cul-de-sac. Be aware, they are definitely out and about.

Take care,

Lady Edwards

Salcedo stared at it and tried to make loud noises to scare it away but the bear did not move.  He and the animal had a standoff... until Salcedo finally found a stick nearby and threw the stick at the bear.  Bear ran off into the woods after that.  Salcedo explained that this was not the first time the bear had come onto his property and was a nuisance in the community for a quite a while.  He had a depredation permit to shoot the bear. So, Salcedo and his father set off to check out the bear, found it, and shot 2 rounds.  The bear was not hit.  Salcedo could tell that it was hunting because he found a dead animal near the spot he saw the bear.  45 minutes later, he contacted the local sheriff office.  An officer called him back but Salcedo is not sure if it is from the same agency.  He was advised to report this to CDFW.  The dead animal he found had two sets of large canine teeth marks on it.

The bear was on my property and foraging for food in our trash can. When I opened my front door the bear was walking across my driveway and was not frightened by my presence nor flashlight and the flash on my iphone camera. It proceeded down the ivy toward my neighbor's trash can. The car panic button was pressed and when the car lights flashed and horn honked the bear climbed up a large incense cedar tree in my neighbor's front yard that hangs over our driveway. It stayed there beyond 15 minutes. 
The following evening on 10/8/2016 at midnight I saw a cub black bear cross in front of my car on Freeman Ave and run up Phyllis Ave onto my street, Irving Ave, and eventually up a residence's 5 foot high rock wall and into their cedar tree.
Since we have moved into our home 5 weeks ago bears have gotten into our trash can 5-6 times. We normally do not see them, however this encounter was before 8:00pm and there were many people and cars on our street making noise. This was alarming that the bear would come so close with so much obvious human activity. I'm wondering if the bear(s) in my area are becoming more habituated to humans and therefore less avoidant of people. Which is problematic for obvious reasons.
My specific concern is that since this is a mama bear with cubs I've seen on my street and property,  I could be walking to my car not knowing that I'm close to a cub and become a perceived threat to the mama bear. I also have a 2 and 4 year old who are sometime outside in our front yard before 8:00pm.","Closed","Los Angeles",34.2417757,"-118.2258651"

The bear was initially scared away turning on the porch lights and loud noises, but returned after about 30 minutes. Turning on more lights on the property revealed that there was a cub with the bear. The bears entered the front lawn koi pond and knocked over a concrete fountain. The bear also entered a car on the driveway through an open driver’s side window to eat a bag of chips. After this incident care was taken to keep all car windows closed, not keep any food in the cars, not keep any trash in the kitchen/front porch, always latch metal kitchen entry gate, keep all porch lights on at night, and set out towels soaked in ammonia in the kitchen each evening. 

9/24/2016 5am: the bear and cub were seen on recorded video walking across the front porch towards outdoor kitchen. They stopped to smell the kitchen but did not attempt to open the latched gate or gain entry in other ways. The bear can be heard in the recording attempting to knock over a neighbor’s trashcan. 

9/25/2016, 7pm (dusk): The bear and cub were seen by neighbors when their dog’s barking drove the bears up a tree by a trailer-home being used by guests. Within minutes of the bears climbing down the tree, they were seen again in the driveway close to our front porch and could be heard attempting to knock over a trash can. At this time, our direct next door neighbor drove up the driveway to find the bears going through his trash. He honked his car horn, and the two bears climbed up a pine tree within reach of his front balcony. After a few minutes the bears came down and went back up the hill.
 
10/2/2016, 10:30pm: The bear and cub were seen on the driveway approaching the kitchen/porch area. They retreated up the hill after a neighbor made loud noises. 

10/5/2016, 11pm: A bear was noted to be in the outdoor kitchen area of the porch and had broken the latches on the refrigerator door. The bear appeared to have entered by climbing over the kitchen wall. This was despite measures taken nightly to secure the kitchen and deter the bear such as: locking the metal entryway gate, keeping all porch and kitchen lights on, ensuring no trash was left in the kitchen, closing the refrigerator door with three child-safety locks, and placing ammonia-soaked towels on the entry gate and wall. Sheriff deputies responded to our 9-1-1 call. We removed all remaining food from the refrigerator. The bear returned at about 2am to rummage through the kitchen, the neighbor's trash can, and the front lawn koi pond.","Closed","Los Angeles",34.2081238,"-118.1349"

  Well the bear has made another appearance.  It was in my yard at about 2:30 this morning apparently trying to get back over my fence into the canyon.  The fence has been extended so the bear tried to bend the fence (heavy chain link) and get over Jacks's wall and in the process pulled blocks down off the wall.  He did not have any luck so finally left.  He managed to get in some of the neighbors trash in the process. It seems all we can hope for is the bear eventually goes in to hibernation. Will keep in touch with further developments if there are any.  Take care.

Imagine that.  So, I decided to make a report.

Today my next door neighbor saw a bear come onto their property, but did nothing but look around and then head back into Pepperwood Preserve.  

Last Saturday, June 11th, we had what we assume was the same bear on our property.  It hung around for 20 to 30 minutes checking things out and ended up trying to get into our garden and tore down some fencing which was easy to repair.  

Some neighbors within maybe a three mile radius have reported sightings over the last weeks.  I figure as long as there is no damage to us or the bear we will let it do its thing.  Any suggestions in that regard?

We attempted to drive them off with loud noises but they seemed unimpressed with our efforts and finally left when they felt good and ready to. Neighbors of ours have reported a similar pair of bears raiding their property including ripping apart chicken coops and killing all the chickens. The bears have been in the area several months now and seem to have established a route they follow to raid garbage cans and other interesting sites. While I have no particular desire to kill these animals, but I am very concerned about what they might do to our horses, goats, pets, and us.

I went outside with a very bright flashlight and observed a bear attempting to pull the gate open to my chicken pen. A bear had damaged the gate that very morning and I had repaired it and strengthened the latch in an attempt to keep the bear out. I released my dog from his crate he is kept in at night and he ran toward the bear, barking and growling at it.The bear did not run away from my dog (Labrador Retriever) when the dog came very close and was still barking loudly and growling. I went back into my house and got a rifle from my gun safe as I felt that the bear was not afraid of my dog and was actually trying to attack my dog. This took me a few minutes and when I went back outside they had moved to the other side of the fence approximately 40-50 yards from their initial encounter at the pen The bear did not run away as expected from the dog or from me yelling loudly at it. I yelled at it to ""Go Away!"" and it showed no signs of retreat. The bear clearly knew I was there. I was calling my dog, but every time he began to come in my direction, the bear would act aggressive and advance quickly toward my dog. Since I was not able to get my dog away from the bear without the bear acting as if he wanted to harm my dog, I continued to call my dog in an attempt to get him away from the bear. But, when the dog would come toward me, so would the bear as he advanced toward my dog. Fearing for the safety of my dog which I believed would be at any moment caught or bitten by the bear, I shined the bright flashlight directly one the bear. Up until this time I had not done so as I was hoping he would quickly retreat and I did not want to obstruct his vision with the light. When my dog retreated from the bear and the bear still acted aggressively toward my dog, I shined the light on the bear and fired my rifle directly at the bear. Upon daylight, I found no dead bear. As I intentionally targeted, and fired, at the animals glowing eyes I would expect a dead bear very close to where it had been at the time, or a complete miss. Either way, the bear did not continue to advance quickly toward my dog after I fired at it.

"WIR-2016-000122","1/12/2016 0:00","Black Bear","General Nuisance","At approximately 2am on Tuesday 01/12/16 I heard what sounded like a knock at our door.  Upon further investigation, I discovered a large bear, medium to dark brown in color, licking out the bottom of our empty garbage tote.  Let's call it 250 to 300 lbs (Est).  Then the bear finds a little dry cat food on our back porch for our feral cat and leaves his ""calling card"" on our back porch.  Then he finds my smoker and tips it over for the rancid Turkey grease from Thanksgiving (gross and my fault).  Anyway I come out on the back porch and it heads to a large nearby pine and starts to tree itself.  I back off into the house (one of the last things I want is for the bear to tree itself). Then he then back off on that idea and saunters off awsy from our place up the hill to the south.  I made sure not to be aggressive (or afraid) and just let him know I was there and that I wasn't going anywhere.  He headed on out and, to my knowledge, hasn't been back since the date of this report.  I have removed the attractants (food) and have a ""super soaker"" squirt gun with ammonia/water mix for any future incursions.  I don't recall having extended a social invitation for any late night visits by, well, anyone!  Thanks much, Glenn","Closed","Napa",38.4267985,"-122.3006845"

I just learned about this reporting web site, but have made at least 4 calls to the Napa office to report bear sightings. In the past 45 days we have had 6-7 bear sightings in the Circle Oaks Community. Many of the reportings have been cubs, but the incident reported by the police was of a very large bear...possibly a mother?  I have had no help nor response from the Napa Office...what do we do ??","Closed","Napa",38.4058502,"-122.21031"
